            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Everend, and much honoured Fathers and Brethren, it is a received Maxime, that publike rights and intereſts are to be preferred before private and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; ſpiritual, before ſecular; divine before humane. Now as the internal ſpiritual gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt in the inviſible Church, is farre more excellent then any other: ſo alſo his external viſible government of the viſible Church, hath the preheminence above all viſible civil governments and Kingdoms of this world. And if it be lawful even for private perſons to vindicate, by humane Laws, the extents and rights of their particular civil inheritances and poſſeſſions: and if it be accounted the duty of good ſubjects to vindicate the extents and rights of their civil Soveraigns Dominions, with their Eſtates and Lives, even by the Sword: then much more is it the duty of Chriſts Subjects, by diſputes and argumentations to vindicate the extents and rights of Chriſts external political Kingdom; the one being but of civil concernment, the other divine; the one tending but to a civil end, the other a ſpiritual. And therefore I hope none will blame me for appearing in publike to contend for the extent and rights of Chriſts political Kingdom in his Church here on earth.</p>
            <p>My firſt Theſis on this Subject was compoſed for the private uſe of my ſelf, and ſome few neighbour Miniſters, in a monethly private meeting, according to our cuſtome. But being made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, at the deſires of others, it met with oppoſition from two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brethren: firſt by M. <hi>John Ellis</hi> junior, who undertook to confute it, with other Tractates of divers of my betters that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57278:3"/>
who is ſince departed out of the viſible militant Church, into the inviſible Triumphant; the loſſe of which burning and ſhining light, the Church of God cannot ſufficiently lament. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome things therein ſet down were by them miſtaken, and other things not ſo fully cleared, as I deſired, I thought good to ſet it out again more enlarged, and vindicated from the miſtakes and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that it met withall.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of my ſo long delay herein were, Firſt, becauſe I was the leaſt and leaſt concerned therein, though the moſt tartly dealt withall by M <hi>Ellis.</hi> And ſecondly, becauſe I deſired to ſee ſome of my betters go before me, in vindication of their own Tractates of the ſame ſubject. And thirdly, becauſe I underſtood by M. <hi>Ellis</hi>'s book, and by common fame, that there was an anſwer to M. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi> coming out, wherein I ſhould finde my queſtion diſcuſſed, by that eminent and worthy Divine M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> which was indeed ſent over, but periſhed in the ſea, and ſo was retarded one year lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, until it could be tranſcribed, and ſent over again. And ſince that was printed, the ſeat of the warre, by the ſiege of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> coming ſo near us, we were all in a fear and danger, ſo that I thought it no fit time to attend to controverſies: and I had indeed almoſt laid it quite aſide, but that the importunities of ſome, and the inſultings of others excited me again to take it in hand.</p>
            <p>And now I finde a fourfold unhappineſſe hath betided me herein.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The darkneſſe and ſublimity of the Subject, which I could no way make plain, ſo as to be underſtood by vulgar apprehenſions, becauſe the handling thereof put me neceſſarily upon the uſe of ſo many latine words, and logical terms of art, which are not uſually underſtood by common people. And therefore deſpairing to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but by thoſe that had ſome skill in the Latine tongue, and in Logick, I have ſet down the words of ſuch Authors as I have had occaſion to cite, in their own languages, in which I found them, leſt otherwiſe this Tractate ſhould ſwell too great.</p>
            <p>A ſecond unhappineſſe is, that this Tenet ſeemeth to croſſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our own Divines, in their writings againſt the Papiſts. But indeed it doth only ſeem ſo, for it is manifeſt that the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike which they intend, is not the ſame with this that I have to deal about. For they ſpeak of the Church Catholike conſiſting only of the Elect and I conſent unto them that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

but my queſtion is about the external ſtate of the Church, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hypocrites as well as thoſe that are truly godly, in which Church the Ordinances of worſhip and diſcipline were ſet.</p>
            <p>A third is, that I am fallen upon a ſubject wherein I can finde ſo few going before me, and therefore could have the leſſe help from Authours.</p>
            <p>A fourth is, that I being a mean Countrey-Miniſter, want both thoſe abilities and opportunities, to enable me to write of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, having conſtant employment of preaching in mine own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and frequently abroad, lying upon me, ſo that I cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend polemical Divinity, as they muſt that undertake ſuch a work.</p>
            <p>My principal ſcope in this and the former Theſis, is to prove that there is one Church Catholike viſible on earth: and that Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and donation of the Ordinances of worſhip and diſcipline, was firſt to the whole Church, and ſecondarily to the particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as parts thereof. And yet I acknowledge the ordinary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant exerciſe of thoſe Ordinances is primarily in the particular Churches, and a ſecondary and only occaſional exerciſe of them in greater parts thereof; and a very rare exerciſe of them in the whole <hi>conjunctim</hi> upon ſome general extraordinary occaſion, and that can be no otherwiſe, then by delegated Commiſſioners from the ſeveral parts of the whole, when convenible.</p>
            <p>If it be conceived by any that ſome of the Arguments in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate are multiplied more then is needfull, and are laid down more ſingly then was meet, I will not deny it: Be pleaſed in the reading of them to conſider them together, and I hope they will prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive.</p>
            <p>I finde alſo by the review of this Tractate, that ſome things are ofter touched upon then I was aware of: be pleaſed to impute it part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my forgetfulneſſe, and partly to mine endeavour to follow the method of my former Theſis, and yet to anſwer what was objected againſt it by others, who followed their own methods, which occaſioned ſome coincidency.</p>
            <p>And ſince the tranſcribing of it for the Preſſe, there came to my hands two other Tractates about the ſame ſubject, written from <hi>N. E.</hi> the one in Latine by that reverend and worthy M. <hi>Norton,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> there, in anſwer to <hi>Apollonius;</hi> the other by
<pb facs="tcp:57278:4"/>
two reverend Miniſters, <hi>viz.</hi> M. <hi>Allen,</hi> and M. <hi>Shepard,</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to M. <hi>Ball.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It grieved me much that I ſaw them no ſooner: I have only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted a few annotations upon thoſe tractates, becauſe I was loth to make a Poſtſcript; and becauſe I found that moſt of the material paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in them concerning this ſubject, were already ſpoken unto in this book.</p>
            <p>I have now ſhewed mine opinion on this queſtion, and ſubmit it to your ſage and mature judgements, and ſhould be glad that my betters would ſhew me theirs, and either correct what I have erred or failed in, or make more clear what I have endeavoured to prove and defend. If I have herein erred, I would not willingly be an heretick, but ſhall be willing upon conviction and proof to retract the ſame, but if I have defended a truth (as I conceive I have) I ſhould be glad to be confirmed in it, and gladder to have the truth confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it may appear ſo to others.</p>
            <p>Now God the Father, who is the God of truth; and Jeſus Chriſt, who is the way, the truth, and the life; and the holy Ghoſt, who is the Spirit of truth; guide you and us into all truth. So prayeth,</p>

And if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, Ordinances, and cenſures were given by Chriſt firſt to the Church-general-viſible, and ſecondarily to the Church-particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> Then it will neceſſarily follow, <hi>That the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is not the firſt receptacle of Church-power,</hi> And that <hi>all Church-power is not intirely and independently in a particular Congregation,</hi> which are two of the chief foundations of the Congregational government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall not at all ſpeak to the firſt, but as for this laſt, <hi>That all Church-power is ſolely and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in a particular Congregation,</hi> it ſeems to me not only to be contrary to the Scripture <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 15. Mat. 18.17. Deut. 17.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 Tim. 4.14.</note>, but to the very light of nature, and to carry many great abſurdities with it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It takes away all <hi>authoritative appeals,</hi> and all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative waies of uniting particular Churches one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have no Church-communion in <hi>diſcipline</hi> one with another. They may have <hi>Chriſtian-communion,</hi> but no <hi>Church-communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Then no <hi>Miniſter</hi> could preach as an <hi>Officer</hi> out of his own Congregation, but only as a <hi>gifted brother</hi> and as a <hi>private Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Then no <hi>Miniſter</hi> could adminiſter the <hi>Sacraments</hi> (which is an act of office) out of his own Congregation, nor (as I conceive) give the Sacrament to a member of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Then when his particular Church is diſſolved, he ceaſeth to be a Miniſter, and muſt receive a <hi>New Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Then a Miniſter baptizing a childe, baptizeth him only into his own Congregation. For if he be not an <hi>Officer</hi> of the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> he cannot baptize into the <hi>Catholike Church</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57278:5"/>
which is directly contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Then when the Officers excommunicate a perſon, he ſhould only be excommunicated out of that particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Then Chriſt ſhould have as many intire bodies as <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations;</hi> Chriſt ſhould not only have one <hi>Body</hi> whereof particular Congregations are part, but every <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Body of Chriſt</hi> by it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It would make way for toleration of hereſies and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and let in as many religions as there are particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It would make the Churches of Chriſt ſtand divided one from another in reſpect of government, and thereby bring ruine upon one another. Even as in a civil State, if particular Corporations ſhould be independent from the whole in point of government, it would quickly bring deſtruction upon the whole.</p>
            <p>For the removing of theſe and ſuch like abſurdities, This <hi>learned and iudicious Authour</hi> in the Book fore-mentioned laid down a quite contrary Theſis. <hi>That there is a Catholike, viſible, organical Church, to which Ordinances and cenſures are firſtly given by Ieſus Chriſt. And that every Miniſter is ſeated by God in this Catholike viſible Church, and hath a virtual and habitual power to preach as a Miniſter in any place where he ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called.</hi> Indeed he is not an actual Miniſter of the Church-Catholike, nor hath actually the charge of the whole Church as the Apoſtles had: but habitually only by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definiteneſſe of his office. He hath power <hi>in actu primo</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his office, though not <hi>in actu ſecundo ſive exercito,</hi> he hath <hi>jus ad rem</hi> every where, but not <hi>in re</hi> any where, without a call. He is a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and thereby hath right and power to perform the acts belonging to his office, but for the execution of it, there is required a call there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>This poſition is oppoſed and confuted by the fore-named Authours. And in anſwer to them (but eſpecially to M. <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> and M. <hi>Ellis</hi>) This Reverend Miniſter hath here written a <hi>Vindication,</hi> which he hath done with ſo much meekneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:57278:6"/>
moderation, ingenuity, perſpicuity and learning, that if that holy men of God M. <hi>Hooker</hi> were alive, I doubt not but he would paſſe the ſame judgement upon this Book which he did upon the former. The truth is, The Queſtion is full of difficulty and intricacy, the path in which he walks is an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodden path,</hi> and the pains which he hath taken in the compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this work, and the learning which he hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered herein is ſo great, as I am very confident, <hi>That whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reades the Book will commend the Authour and his abilities, though he ſhould not in every thing reſent his opinion.</hi> The Scope of the Book is to contend for the extents and rights of Chriſts political Kingdom in his Church upon earth, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the unity of it, and thereby to lay a foundation of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity between particular Churches, which is as neceſſary for the preſervation of them, as purity and verity. <hi>For a Church divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sad it is to conſider, That whereas Jeſus Chriſt hath left two waies for the uniting of Chriſtians in faith and love, the devil ſhould make uſe of both of them to diſunite and divide us. The firſt is, <hi>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> which was inſtituted to be a <hi>Feaſt of Love,</hi> and a <hi>Band of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between Chriſtians, but by Satans cunning it hath proved an <hi>apple of ſtrife</hi> and of great contention, not only between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>us</hi> alſo, and our <hi>diſſenting brethren.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>The Government of the Church,</hi> which was ordained by Chriſt to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and as a <hi>golden chain</hi> to link them together in purity, verity and unity, to heal breaches, and to make us minde the ſame things, <hi>and to be perfectly joyned together in the ſame minde, and in the ſame judgement,</hi> But by the devils po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy (whoſe property it is to bring evil out of good) it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the great bone of contention, and a <hi>middle wall of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Chriſtians and Chriſtians.</hi> This is a <hi>lamentation and ſhall be for a lamentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my comfort is, That Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to remove the <hi>wall of partition</hi> that was between Jew and Gentile, and <hi>to make both one,</hi> and he is not only a <hi>foundation</hi>

            <p>M. <hi>Norton</hi> a reverend Miniſter in <hi>N. E.</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Doctrine of Godlineſſe, printed ſince his anſwer to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> defineth the Church-Catholike to be the number of the elect and redeemed, whom God hath called out of the world unto a ſupernatural eſtate and communion of grace and glory with himſelf in Jeſus Chriſt. And affirms that there is but one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, becauſe there is but one faith. And then comes to diſtinguiſh this Catholike Church in reſpect of its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts into inviſible and viſible. And then defines a viſible Church to be a ſimilar part of the Catholike Church, conſiſting of a competent number, knit together by way of viſible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to exerciſe an holy communion with God in Chriſt, and ſo one with another, according to the order of the Goſpel. And then diſtinguiſheth this viſible Church into pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure; impure into 3. branches, <hi>viz.</hi> Simply erring, Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Heretical. And then makes the matter of this viſible Church to be Saints, <hi>i. e.</hi> viſible beleevers. From whence we have theſe conceſſions. 1. That there is a Church-Catholike which is but one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. That this Church Catholike is viſible, yea, let me adde further out of his anſwer to <hi>Apollonius, Politica viſibilitas eſt adjunctum reſpectu Eccleſiae Catholicae,</hi> pag. 87. <hi>i. e.</hi> political viſibility is an adjunct in reſpect of the Church-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. 3. That this Church-Catholike is an integral. 4. That the particular Churches are ſimilar parts of that integral. 5. That theſe particular Churches conſiſt of viſible beleevers, which as himſelf in his anſwer to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> confeſſeth are not all Saints in truth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, in appearance. 6. That ſome of theſe viſible Churches may be impure, not only ſimply erring, but ſchiſmatical, yea, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</p>
            <p>But (ſaving my honourable reſpect to ſo worthy a man) I cannot ſee how theſe things are conſiſtent with his definition of the Church-Catholike: for how can the Church-Catholike conſiſt only of the elect redeemed ones, called out of the world into a ſupernatural eſtate, and yet the particular Churches

And as the body admits of ſuch a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo doth the head alſo, for Chriſt affordeth ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al communion to ſome inwardly, as well as outwardly by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, even ſaving graces and comforts by the Spirit of grace; to others only outwardly by Ordinances, and by common works of his Spirit. In the ſame ſenſe that a viſible Church may be called a myſtical body of Chriſt, Chriſt may alſo be called a myſtical head thereof. As Chriſt terms himſelf a Maſter, ſo he hath evil, ſlothful, unfaithful ſervants and ſtewards: as a King, he hath rebels that will not have him to rule over them, even in his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.14. as a ſhepherd he hath goats as well as ſheep: <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.32. as a houſholder he hath veſſels of diſhonour as well as honour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.2. as a bridegroom he hath fooliſh virgins as well as wiſe invited to the wedding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a husbandman, he hath tares among his wheat, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.25. as a fiſherman, he hath rubbiſh in his net as well as good fiſh <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.47. as a vine, he hath unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful branches as well as fruitful, <hi>Joh</hi> 15.6.

In the N.T. there were ſome in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. that had <hi>not the knowledge of God, denying the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> guilty of <hi>drunkenneſſe</hi> at the Lords table, guilty of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> and <hi>uncleanneſſe,</hi> and <hi>laſciviouſneſſe, and had not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſome in the Church, that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed they knew God, but in works denied him, being abominable,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57278:20"/>
diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate.</hi> And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Having a form of godlineſſe, and denying the power thereof.</hi> And <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>Enemies to the croſſe of Christ, whoſe end is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who minde earthly things.</hi> See what manner of perſons <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeaks of in 12, 13, and 16. verſes. <hi>Spots in their feaſts of charity, feeding themſelves without fear, clouds without water, carried about with windes, trees whoſe fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots, raging waves of the ſea, fom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their own ſhame, wandering ſtars, to whom is reſerved the blackneſſe of darkneſſe for ever: murmurers, complainers, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their own luſts,</hi> &amp;c. Yet theſe were Gods people by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication and conſecration, and God owneth them ſo. And is it not as abſurd for Chriſt to have ſuch branches as ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</p>
                  <p>But though the Metaphor taken from the natural head and members, ſeem to imply ſuch a ſtrict union and communion as to ſet forth only the elect, yet we know that many of them are not called, and ſo in their natural condition as vile as any, and even the beſt on earth are but ſinful men; yet as it is borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a civil head and political body, it is no abſurdity at all. For God himſelf is head and Governour of all the world, and thereby of devils as well as angels, beaſts as well as men, wicked men as well as good, for he is the ſoveraign ruler over all. And Chriſt <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, is ſaid to be <hi>head over all things to the Church his body.</hi> There is therefore a viſible Eccleſiaſtical body, which may alſo in ſome ſenſe be called myſtical: and there is alſo an inviſible ſpiritual body of the elect only, which is moſt properly called myſtical. There are two ſievs or garbles which God uſeth, the firſt is, to fift the world into a viſible Eccleſiaſtical body, over which Chriſt is a myſtical, political, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning head and ruler, and this ſieve is managed by the hands of the Miniſters; the ſecond is to ſift the viſible Eccleſiaſtical body into a ſpiritual inviſible body; and that is in Gods hand only.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to know that this diſtinction of <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> is a very lame one, and the lameneſſe thereof deceiveth many: For whereas all diſtributions ſhould have their parts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and different, and the more oppoſite the members be, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57278:20"/>
better the diſtribution is; theſe two branches of this diſtinction interfier one with another, and the one comprehends the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the viſible comprehend the inviſible here in this world, I mean, the perſons though not the notions For <hi>though indeed every viſible member is not inviſible, yet every inviſible member in the Church is alſo viſible. Ad Catholicam Eccleſiam viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in terris ſe recipere debent, quot quot inviſibilis illius cives eſſe cupiunt.</hi> Polani Syntag. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>Inviſibilis Eccleſia latet in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia viſibili ut pars in toto, frutramque conſideres ut coetum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum externa vocatione, quae communis est inviſibili &amp; viſibili Eccleſiae.</hi> Ibid.</p>
                  <p>They that have inward communion with Chriſt for life, are not taught and nouriſhed only by an inward unction or inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but are fain to have external communion alſo in the outward Ordinances of God. <hi>De Eccleſia vivorum modò agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, cui Symbolum Apoſtolicum praeſcriptum eſt, non decoeleſti.</hi> Ram. <hi>in</hi> Symb.

                  </p>
                  <p>If inviſible had been taken for Saints in heaven, and viſible for Saints on earth, it had been a compleat diſtinction. Or if viſible had been taken for a Church conſpicuous, flouriſhing with liberty of Ordinances; and inviſible for a Church latent, as under perſecutions, and general hereſies, then it had been compleat; but the terms are not uſed in either of thoſe ſenſes, and therefore the diſtinction halteth. So that in what is to be ſaid we muſt take heed that by viſible we mean not only ſuch as are hypocrites and reprobates, but thoſe that are alſo truly godly: not only ſuch as make external profeſſion of faith, whereby they are differenced from heathens, but ſuch as have inward ſincerity alſo, whereby they are differenced from hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>

and therefore (ſay they) it had better have been ſaid, called out of the <hi>world.</hi> But I anſwer, that that expreſſion would have admitted of as much exception, for there is much of the <hi>world</hi> in the Church. <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.9. which was meant of the reprobate Jews, which yet were in the viſible Church. If I had made a deſcription of the inviſible Church, it had been right to have ſaid called out of the world, but ſpeaking of the viſible Church, Idols are the moſt proper contradiſtinct term to the living God, and Idolatry that which onely cauſeth a divorce between God and a viſible Church; and obſtinate prophaneneſſe, which is oppoſite to the <hi>profeſſed ſubjection,</hi> mentioned in the deſcription. And though ſome converted ſhould have been Jews or Athieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that never were Idolaters, yet my deſcription takes them in, for I mean a ſeparation or call both <hi>privatively</hi> and <hi>negatively,</hi> priatively, if they have been Idolaters, negatively, though they never were, <hi>i. e.</hi> there muſt be a diſclaiming of Idols nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, though there never were a poſitive worſhipping of them. As if a neuter who never ſtruck in of any ſide, ſhall ſide with one oppoſite, there muſt be a diſclaiming of the other oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond exception againſt it is, Becauſe a Church may be a Church, though they fall to ſome Idolatry, as the ten Tribes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57278:21"/>
were owned by God as his people though Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, there were 7000. in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the worſt times, that lived <hi>latent</hi> among the Idolaters, <hi>who never bowed the knee to</hi> Baal, <hi>nor kiſſed him,</hi> and God might own the people for their ſakes, being the better part, though the leſſe. Secondly, though God doth not divorce a Church for all Idolatry, yet they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. And at laſt came forth the ſentence of <hi>Lo-ammi</hi> and <hi>Lo-ruhamah</hi> againſt the ten Tribes for it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.6.9. Thirdly, I anſwer, it may be <hi>verè Eccleſia</hi> (as is ſaid of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by ſome) but not <hi>vera &amp; pura:</hi> and it was needful for me, as near as I could, to give a deſcription of a true Church. But I will not contend with any about this deſcription, you may take a more comprehenſive deſcription. A viſible Church may be deſcribed to be a company <hi>of thoſe that own or do profeſſe the doctrine of Chriſt.</hi> Or <hi>ſuch as profeſſe the true Religion.</hi>

And in that ſenſe I ſuppoſe M. <hi>Ellis</hi> intends it in the title of his book which he cals <hi>Vindiciae Catholicae,</hi> a found or Orthodox vindication. For if he means by it A general vindication againſt all that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert a Church-Catholike viſible, he is miſtaken therein alſo; for M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath written profeſſedly of my queſtion in both the branches of it, that there is a Church-Catholike viſible, and that it is the prime Church: though I confeſſe I knew not of it when I printed my <hi>Theſis.</hi> But this ſignification doth not fully comprehend my meaning of the word. Secondly, <hi>Catholike</hi> is taken for an office in the Church, next under a Patriarch, that was as his Vicar general, and is called in Latine <hi>Rationalis:</hi> See <hi>Salmaſ. de primat.

the minde of man comprehending divers different <hi>ſpecies</hi> under it. Fourthly, It is taken in the ſame ſenſe that we uſe to take <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> that which is or may be all over the world. The firſt and laſt ſenſe are only pertinent to this Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Orthodox Church over all the earth, and eſpecially this latter, and therefore now I have inſerted the word <hi>Oecumenical</hi> into the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>And in both theſe ſenſes <hi>Auguſtine</hi> takes it, who ſaith, the Church is called Catholike, <hi>Quia univerſaliter perfecta est, &amp; in nullo claudicat, &amp; per totum orbem diffuſa est.</hi> Aug. <hi>de</hi> Gen. <hi>ad l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We are to know that the Church of God admits of ſeveral diſtinctions from ſeveral accidents. As in reference to the <hi>times</hi> wherein the Church hath exiſted, or doth exiſt, it is diſtributed into the Church under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and the Church under the <hi>New;</hi> And this again is diſtributed into the <hi>primitive</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſive:</hi> So in regard of the places where the Church doth exiſt, or perſons of whom it conſiſteth, it receiveth the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>particular.</hi> Now in this queſtion, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal is meant principally in regard of <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and not in regard of time. <hi>The Church Catholike existing on earth at the ſame time, is compared with particular Churches exiſting at the ſame time alſo.</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57278:25"/>
enjoyment of all the uſual publike Ordinances, then a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, Claſſical Church: and ſo, though it be a deſcription of a particular Church indeed, yet not of the leaſt particular Church.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Cotton</hi> a reverend Miniſter in <hi>N. E.</hi> in his Catechiſm tels us, that a <hi>viſible Church is a myſtical body, whereof Chriſt is the head, the Members, Saints, called out of the world, and united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one Congregation, by an holy Covenant, to worſhip the Lord, and to edifie one another in all his holy Ordinances.</hi> But (with due reſpect to ſo grave and worthy a man) much of this deſcription ſeems to me to belong to an inviſible Church, and not to a viſible. Firſt, becauſe the matter thereof is the myſtical body of Chriſt, conſiſting only of Saints called (not only from <hi>Idols,</hi> but) out of the <hi>world,</hi> and therefore truly godly; but much of the world is in the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Every Congregation, though it be in ſome ſenſe of the myſtical body of Chriſt, yet is not <hi>the,</hi> or <hi>a myſticall body</hi> of Chriſt, for Chriſt hath but one myſtical body; it behooveth therefore a particular Church to be defined with reference to the reſt of the body, and not to the head only, it being but a part of the body. It would ſeem ſtrange to define the <hi>little toe</hi> to be a body made up of fleſh, bloud and bone, of ſuch a figure, enformed by the head, without declaring the reference of it to the reſt of the body. Or a Corporation in <hi>England</hi> to be a body politick whereof the King is the head or Soveraign, without mentioning its reference to the reſt of the Kingdom, whereof it is but a part, and ſo the King, the head or gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereof, but ſecondarily, it being a part of that Kingdom whereof he was Soveraign. It is true, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the head of every man is Christ.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.3. <hi>i. e.</hi> they are of the body of Chriſt. So it may be ſaid of every Congregation, Chriſt is the head thereof and that it is of his body or kingdom viſible Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, but then we muſt adde that which the Apoſtle doth of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.27. <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt,</hi>

upon the place. <hi>Nam omnes Eccleſiae per orbem diſperſae, diverſa ſunt unius corporis membra.</hi> And the Engliſh Annotations upon the Bible, paraphraſe it thus. <hi>That is, members of this Church of Corinth, which is but a part of the Catholike Chriſtian Church: for all the faithfull whereſoever they are, make the whole body: you Corinthians are not the whole body, but members only, neither all the members, but a part only of them.</hi> Paraeus <hi>renders it</hi> partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, <hi>Peter Martyr, Voseſtis pars membrorum.</hi> Thirdly, I dare not make a particular explicite holy <hi>covenant</hi> to be the <hi>form</hi> of a particular Church, as this definition ſeemeth to do, becauſe I finde no mention of any ſuch Covenant, beſides the general impoſed on Churches, nor example or warrant for it in all the Scriptures, and therefore cannot account it an Ordinance of God, but a prudential humane device to keep the members together, which in ſome places and caſes may haply be of good uſe, ſo it be not urged as an Ordinance of God, and ſo it be not uſed to inthral any, and abridge them of liberty of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val into other places and Congregations, for their convenience; or urged as the form of a Church. I deny not but mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of perſons within ſuch a vicinity, to joyn together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the Ordinances of God under the inſpection of ſuch and ſuch officers, is requiſite to a particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p>But it is the general preceding Covenant ſealed by baptiſm, and not this, that makes them of the body of Chriſt: they muſt be conceived to be of the viſible body of Chriſt, before they can be fit members to conſtitute a particular Congregation; neither is it this particular Covenant that giveth right to the Ordinances of God, but the general, and therefore they muſt be judged to have right thereto before they be admitted as members of the Congregation. Only this mutual joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, and choice of ſuch and ſuch a Paſtor or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ruling Elders, giveth ſuch Officers a call to take immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate inſpection over them, and adminiſter the Ordinances of God belonging to their offices, unto them, to which they had right before their particular conſociation, which is but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentary thing, and may many waies be diſſolved, and yet they not loſe their right to Gods Ordinances by that diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such a conſent, joyning, and call of, or ſubmitting to a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57278:26"/>
Presbytery, giveth to thoſe Elders right of exerciſing of their offices, over, or towards them, rather then over others; and to them, to expect or require the Ordinances of God from thoſe particular Officers, rather then from others.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, For the enjoyment of all the Ordinances of God in one Congregation, it ſeemeth to me very <hi>incovenient</hi> for ſome of the Ordinances, and altogether <hi>impoſſible</hi> for others. Firſt, It is <hi>inconvenient,</hi> that a Church conſiſting of 7.10.20. or 30. ſhould inflict the formidable ſentence of excommunication againſt any perſon, to caſt him out of communion, not only with themſelves, but the whole Church-Catholike viſible, and deliver him up to Satan. For if it be inflicted by the votes of the whole Congregation (as ſome would have it) many of the members being private men, and haply altogether illiterate and unexperienced, through want of age, education, or parts, are not able to underſtand the nature of the allegations and probations, they may be ſo intricate, or not able to apply the rule unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is impoſſible for one Congregation to enjoy all the Ordinances of God within themſelves. Firſt, <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> are acknowledged to be an Ordinance of God, and particularly by that reverend Divine M. <hi>Cotton</hi> himſelf, and he groundeth it on <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And though ſome of our brethren for Congregational Churches wave that place, yet grant the thing, and are members of one at this time; and this Ordinance all men will grant, cannot be had in one Congregation, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times requires the help of a whole <hi>Province, Kingdom,</hi> yea <hi>many Kingdoms.</hi> Yea ſecondly, The Ordinances that more nearly and particularly concern a particular Congregation cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by that alone. For how can a Congregation, of private Chriſtians <hi>try the ſufficiency of an Elder,</hi> to be elected over them, to labour in word and doctrine? and if they have a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man among them, who ſhall <hi>give him impoſition</hi> of hands, which belongeth only unto Elders of the ſame kinde to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? Neither have our brethren of Congregational Churches (whatever their judgement is herein) ever dared (as far as I have heard) to permit private members to impoſe hands on their Elders, but alwaies deſired Elders of other Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to do it, and therefore they cannot have this Ordinance within themſelves. And though this ſeemeth to ſome a thing of ſmall moment, yea, but a complement, yet it is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. The truth is, election is but a nomination of a man which they think fit to be inveſted with, and put into ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57278:27"/>
an office, and to whom ſo inveſted they are willing to ſubmit themſelves in the Lord, but that giveth no power at all to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the office, nor doth it inveſt him with it, for that is given and done by Ordination, and impoſition of hands, which they cannot give becauſe they are but private Chriſtians out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the leſſe ought to be bleſſed of the greater. And the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. reckoneth it up amongſt the <hi>principles of Religion,</hi> and part of the <hi>foundation.</hi> Which place <hi>Hen. Jacob</hi> urgeth vehemently to overthrow the lawfulneſſe and eſſence of all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe (ſaith he) they have erred in the <hi>foundation,</hi> not having right, and due impoſition of hands of the Presbytery: though by his leave, he was miſtaken, for all thoſe that impoſed their hands on them, were Presbyters. But this dealing is not fair, to hold impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands a part of the foundation, that ſo they may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Miniſtery of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and then make it but a complement, that they may eſtabliſh their own.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57278:28"/>
but in the largeſt ſenſe, for that which hath not the firſt right or firſt conſideration, but a <hi>Poſterior.</hi> In the Queſtion, <hi>Primum,</hi> or <hi>firſt,</hi> is meant, that which hath the priority in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Whether in our apprehenſion of Churches we are to begin at the Church-Catholike, and deſcend to particular Churches, or begin at the particular, and aſcend to the Church Chatholike? which notion is firſt in diſtinct knowledge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eccleſia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis, aut Particularis?</hi> Whether the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, priviledges and Ordinances, belong firſt to the Church Catholike? and ſecondarily to the particular Churches: I do not mean (as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> ſuppoſeth) that the power of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces go by way of diſcention or derivation of power from the Church-Catholike, indiſpenſation of Ordinances, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: for I acknowledge power to be given immediatly to every particular Church therein, yet under regulation of a greater part of Church-Officers, in caſe of male-adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The properties and power of water is primarily given to the whole element of water, but is immediatly, yet ſecondarily in the particular parcels thereof.</p>
                  <p>But the Catholike Church is the primary in a threefold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Firſt, as the Orthodox Catholike Church is a means or inſtrument by the Ordinances, Miniſtery and members thereof, in the ſeveral parts and places thereof, to convert, adde, and bring in more new members thereunto; and in continually conquering out of Satans and Antichriſts Kingdom, and leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world with the doctrine of Chriſt. Secondly, as the Church-Catholike affords matters and members, to make up or conſtitute the particular Congregations, which conſiſt only of the members of the Catholike Church, gathered up from any place of the world into particular vicinities. Thirdly, in regard the Ordinances and priviledges of the Church, are primarily intended and given by Chriſt, by one Charter unto the whole Church, and to particular Churches ſecondarily, as parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And ſo they partake of the benefits and priviledges of the Church, not becauſe they are members of the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, though there they have the immediate opportunity, but of the Church-Catholike. As a Corporation already conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Charter, receiveth in free men continually, and giveth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57278:28"/>
freedome to new members which come any way to have right thereto, and thoſe members have right to the priviledges of the City, not becauſe they are of ſuch a ſtreet, or ward, or company, but becauſe they are tree of the City.</p>
                  <p>So that though I have retained the terms of M. <hi>Parkers</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, <hi>prima</hi> and <hi>Orta ſive ſecundaria,</hi> yet my queſtion differs much from his. For he compares the particular Churches who delegate and ſend members or commiſſioners to conſtitute a Claſſis or Synod, with ſuch a miniſterial Church, a Church of Officers ſo conſtituted, for ſome eſpecial ends, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> which ſome call a repreſentative Church: and I confeſſe with him that ſuch a Church may well put on the notion of <hi>Eccleſia Orta,</hi> and the particular Churches out of which theſe members are delegated, may in ſome ſenſe (in reference unto them) put on the notion of <hi>Eccleſiae prima.</hi> Yet I do not conceive that thoſe particular Churches give either the office, or the power <hi>in actu primo,</hi> whereby thoſe delegated Commiſſioners do act when they are met, but by ſuch delegation they do evocate and call forth the exerciſe of that power which Chriſt hath annexed to their office habitually, <hi>in actum ſecundum,</hi> to act <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> for the good of all thoſe Churches ſo ſending, which acts of theirs binde the delegating Churches to ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Lord. But in my Queſtion the whole Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like viſible is compared with the particular Churches, and they are conſidered as parts thereof.</p>

                  <p>I know that our Divines in anſwer to the Pontificians, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Church-Catholike to be viſible, as <hi>Zanchy, Gerard, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, Chamier,</hi> and <hi>Ames</hi> againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Sadeel</hi> againſt <hi>Turrianus,</hi> and <hi>against the Monks Confeſſion of faith, and D.</hi> Willet <hi>in his Synopſ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they reſtraining the ſignification of the word <hi>Church,</hi> to the better part of the Church, the <hi>Elect</hi> only, and conſidering them in reſpect of their internal communion with Chriſt their head, and not their external communion one with another by Ordinances, did deny the Church-Catholike to be viſible. <hi>Nec a quovis impio, nec pio videri poteſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Whitaker.</hi> And if the word <hi>Church</hi> be taken in that ſenſe, it is moſt certainly true, it muſt needs be inviſible, But there is alſo an external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion (as hath been ſhewed before) which the viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have, both with Chriſt and one with another, which is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and makes the enjoyers thereof viſible one to another, and to all others alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> their praying one with another and for another, and their hearing the Word, and receiving the Lords-Supper together as occaſion is offered, and their recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all thoſe as viſible members of the viſible myſtical King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and body of Chriſt, that are admitted in any part of the Church by baptiſm, and the avoiding of ſuch as are any where excommunicated, and the receiving again into communion thoſe that are any where abſolved.</p>
                  <p>So that there is an external viſible Kingdom of Chriſt, as well as an internal and inviſible, and the elect are of the viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57278:29"/>
as well as of the inviſible; they are as <hi>Ezechiels</hi> wheels, a wheel in the midſt of a wheel.</p>
                  <p>It is true which reverend M. <hi>Hooker</hi> puts me in minde of, that theſe 4. Queſtions between the Pontificians and our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines: are diſtinct. <hi>

                  <p>The Pontificians notion of the Church Catholike is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, for they hold the name <hi>Church-Catholike</hi> to belong to one Church, <hi>viz. the Church of Rome:</hi> and that being the Church-Catholike, and comprizing the univerſality of the Church in it ſelf, all that will be members of the Church-Catholike muſt ſubmit unto them and be members of that.

                  </p>
                  <p>And the neceſſity which they make that this one viſible Church ſhould be under one viſible univerſal head on earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope, as Chriſts vicar general, is as abſurd: and therefore they are worthily confuted by our Divines.</p>
                  <p>But to deny an external Kingdome or Church of Chriſt upon earth: or to deny the viſibility or perceptibility of it: or the unity of it, or the univeſality of it under the Goſpel (is as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) as abſurd on the other ſide. To the particulars I ſhall ſpeak more fully in following Chapters.

The political body or Church-viſible (ſaith he) reſults out of that relation, which is betwixt the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the faith, when by voluntary conſent they yeeld out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubjection to that government of Chriſt which in his word he hath preſcribed, and as an <hi>external head</hi> exerciſeth by his Word, Spirit, and Diſcipline, by his Ordinances and Officers over them, who have yeelded themſelves ſubjects to his headſhip and ſupream authority.

                     </note> becauſe they are a divine teſtimony. And firſt I ſhall ſhew you that an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical univerſal Church was frequently foretold in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 22.27. <hi>All the ends of the world, ſhall remember, and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations ſhall worſhip be fore him.</hi> Which comprehends all places, all the ends of the earth, and all perſons that ſhould be converted, all the kindreds of the Nations: and by worſhipping is meant embracing the true religion, and performance of religious duties. So <hi>Pſa.</hi> 72.8. <hi>He ſhall have dominion alſo from ſea to ſea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</hi> It is a prophecy concerning Chriſt in the times of the Goſpel: where he is ſet forth by his Kingly office; and the extent of his Kingdom is ſet out to be to the ends of the earth. This is his external political Kingdom, becauſe it is ſet out by the external prayers and prayſes and gifts that ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57278:31"/>
be tendred unto him by his Subjects, and by the judgement, peace, and flouriſhing eſtate that he ſhall beſtow upon them. So <hi>Pſa.</hi> 86.9. <hi>All Nations whom thou hast made, ſhall come and worſhip before thee, O Lord, and ſhall glorifie thy name.</hi> This is a prophecy like the former, So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in the last daies, that the mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed on the top of the mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the hils, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it, and many people ſhall go and ſay, Come ye, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his waies, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion ſhall go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem, and he ſhall judge among the Nations, and rebuke many people,</hi> &amp;c. Where is ſet down Chriſts call of all the Nations, and the time of this call, in the laſt daies, <hi>i. e.</hi> the times under the Goſpel, as the Apoſtle <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17. expounds the like phraſe in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. And here is the means of the call, by the Law out of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem: and the anſwer to this call, All Nations ſhall flow unto it: and there is Chriſts executing his propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal office by publike teaching them in his houſe, by his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and his Kingly office in judging and rebuking. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.6.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.14. <hi>There was given unto him (Chriſt) Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and glory, and a Kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages ſhould ſerve him.</hi> And in the New Teſtament <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.11, 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. But becauſe theſe places will be turned off with this anſwer, that ſome of all Nations ſhould embrace the Goſpel, and be turned unto the Lord, not the whole Nations: I anſwer, that experience hath proved it true of multitudes of great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that wholly did embrace the Goſpel, and ſubmitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Neither can any of theſe places be avoided (as ſome plead) by the general Kingdom of Chriſt, which is given him over all Nations, whereby he is head over all things to the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.2. For it is clear they are meant of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom wherein are prayers, praiſes, gifts, worſhip, ſervice, and attendance upon Gods Ordinances, flowing unto Chriſt, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping before him, and glorifying his name, as the ſeveral

texts expreſſe; and theſe things are proper to the viſible Church. So alſo <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9. <hi>And the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth: in that day ſhall there be one Lord, and his name one,</hi> which is clearly meant of one religion and way of worſhip of God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> I will give you places of Scripture where the word Church is applied both indefinitely and generally, which cannot be underſtood of any particular Churches. See firſt <hi>Act.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Saul made havock of the Church.</hi> To which may be added that of <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13. <hi>I perſecuted the Church of God, and waſted it.</hi> I ſhewed before that this muſt needs be a viſible Church, for they could not elſe have been perſecuted; perſecution is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible oppoſition of a viſible Church. And certainly <hi>Saul</hi> could not diſcern who were of the inviſible company, but perſecuted promiſcuouſly <hi>all that were that way.</hi> Neither was it a particular Church, for this perſecution was in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>in every Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,</hi> and it reached to <hi>Damaſcus, and even to strange cities,</hi> Act. 26.11. So that by <hi>Church</hi> here is meant <hi>an indefinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of viſible Churches</hi> or Congregations, which were in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther community but profeſſion of the ſame faith, and an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>is equivalent to a general:</hi> which axiome although it ſhould not be ſtretched according to the old rule, <hi>Omne indefinitum poteſt eſſe infinitum,</hi> it being without limits, yet it is true <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> it is as large as a general. But this we may ſafely ſay, that by the ſame reaſon that the word <hi>Church</hi> would reach all thoſe Churches, it would reach all the Churches in the world.</p>
                  <p>Reverend M. <hi>Hooker</hi> excepteth againſt theſe two places, and affirms that the word <hi>Church</hi> is taken here by a <hi>Synechdoche</hi> for the particular Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and not all that neither, but only ſuch Chriſtians as forſook <hi>Moſes</hi> ceremonial Law, and not the Chriſtian Jewiſh Church. <hi>Surv.</hi> c. 15. p. 269. Becauſe ſaith he, his Commiſſion was to purſue ſuch as <hi>he found of that way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The anſwer to this exception will lie in the meaning of theſe words, <hi>all that he found of that way,</hi> whether by <hi>that way,</hi> be meant the forſaking the ceremonial Law, or confeſſing <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> If the former, then <hi>Paul</hi> would have found
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57278:32"/>
but little work in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for the Jewiſh Chriſtians did ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally cleave to the ceremonial Law. As the Elders told <hi>Paul</hi> Act. 21.20. Thou ſeeſt how many myriads of the Jews do believe, and they are all zealous of the Law, and therefore he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not perſecute them for neglect thereof, for they were zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous therein, yea, the Apoſtles themſelves obſerved that in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> a long time. But the perſecution was ſuch, as that they were all ſcattered abroad except the Apoſtles; and therefore it was for Chriſtianiſm that he perſecuted them. It was to cauſe them to blaſpheme, as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf expounds it: now though reducing of them to the ceremonial Law had been an errour, yet it was not a blaſphemy, for then the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould have lived in <hi>blaſphemy.</hi> Surely it was to cauſe them to blaſpheme the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and deny him to be the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> It is moſt likely that <hi>Sauls</hi> Commiſſion was according the former decree of the chief Prieſts, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.22. <hi>That if any did confeſſe that he was Chriſt, he ſhould be put out of the Synagogue.</hi> And this appears by what <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaith to Chriſt concerning <hi>Paul.</hi> Act. 9.14. <hi>Here he hath authority from the chief Prieſts to binde all that call on thy name.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>If he found any that way;</hi> Not all of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or if he found any of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that were fled thither, but any Jews; for the Gentiles had not yet received the Goſpel. For Chap. 10. <hi>Peter</hi> was charged for eating with <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, that were Gentiles. And they that were ſcattered abroad by <hi>Saul,</hi> preached <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel to none but to the Iews only,</hi> Act. 11.19. And ſome of thoſe whom <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted were <hi>men of Cyprus and Cyrene,</hi> Act. 11.20. But it was <hi>all that call on thy name,</hi> not all that had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ceremonial Law, for that very few Jews as yet had done, if any at all. And this was the reaſon, as I conceive, that the commiſſion given to <hi>Saul</hi> by the chief Prieſts, teached the Jews at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and other cities, becauſe they were not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len off from the ceremonial Law, but kept fellowſhip with the Jewiſh Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and came up to the feaſts ſtill, and ſo were under their Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, and liable to their cenſure, and they could write to the rulers of thoſe Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues to ſee them puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it is ſaid upon the converſion of <hi>Saul,</hi> Act. 9.31. <hi>Then
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57278:32"/>
had the Churches rest in all Iudea, and Galilee, and Samaria.</hi> which yet were but ſome parts of the <hi>Church,</hi> (in the ſingular number) which he perſecuted. Now if <hi>Saul</hi> had perſecuted only the members of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken <hi>Moſes</hi> law, then <hi>they</hi> might have had reſt before, for all him, for <hi>they</hi> ſhould not have been within his commiſſion: but he perſecuted them alſo. So our brethren themſelves expound it. <hi>Except.</hi> p. 17. Alſo it is ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 12.1. that <hi>Herod</hi> ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth his hands to vex certain of the Church, and he killed <hi>Iames,</hi> and attached <hi>Peter.</hi> Now this was a viſible Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Church liable to viſible perſecution; and an Organical Church, becauſe the perſecution was againſt the Officers; and the Catholike Church: for it is not ſaid, Certain of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but indefinitely, The Church: and the two perſons named were not Officers or members of the Church of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but Officers of the whole Church, being Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it is ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. <hi>God added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved</hi> Or, ſaved men, as ſome render it. Not that all ſhould be ſaved, or were ſaved men that were added unto it, for there were many hypocrites added, but thoſe that ſhould be ſaved, or were ſanctified, were added. Which <hi>Church</hi> was not a particular Congregational Church, but the Catholike.</p>
                  <p>Reverend M. <hi>Hooker</hi> excepteth againſt this, and ſaith, that <q>it was not the Catholike Church, but the Apoſtolical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church now erected, and not the whole company of beleevers in the whole world, for ſuch a company they never ſaw nor knew, and therefore could not be added to them.</q> 
                     <hi>Surv.</hi> c. 15. p. 270.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true indeed, it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to the Apoſtolical Chriſtian Church, but not to any particular Congregational Church. For firſt, no man by converſion is added unto, or made a member of a or the particular Church where he was converted, but is made a member of the Catholike ſociety of Chriſtians by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and then joins himſelf unto ſome particular ſociety of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Apoſtolical Chriſtian Church was not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church, for thoſe 120 (ſuppoſe them the 12 and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57278:33"/>
70 and ſome others) were many of them men of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and reſided at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> but for a time, <hi>per accidens,</hi> by command, until they were further endued with the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> And thoſe 3000 that were added to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. were men out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very nation under heaven, <hi>ve.</hi> 5. and their particular countries, named, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10, 11. And this is our brethrens own expoſition, <hi>in their exceptions to the proofs from the Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> p. 16. Where they ſay <q>they were not ſetled dwellers at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> but ſtrangers, commorants of the 10 Tribes which were diſperſed, and were but ſojourners at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up to the feaſt, having their wives, and children, and families at home, to whom they uſed after a time to return. And that this continuing ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, was but only while they were there at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Yea, ſome of them were of <hi>Iudea,</hi> ver. 9. and ſo of the countrey round about, and that of them might be Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es erected in their proper dwellings, is rationally ſuppoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the proof M. <hi>Hooker</hi> giveth (to ſhew it was not the Church-Catholike) from <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>They continued ſtedfaſtly</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip;</hi> makes much againſt a Congregational Church, as I conceive. For the Apoſtles were not Congregational Elders to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Officers of the Church-Catholike by their Commiſſion. So that this communion of theirs with the Apoſtles, was not a particular Church-communion, but a Catholike communion of Catholike members (not reduced into particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) with Catholike Officers. Neither might the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> joyn as particular Elders of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For how could they binde themſelves by an holy Covenant to the conſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, or enjoyment of all the Ordinances of God, to or with them, ſeeing their charge was to go over all the world; yet ſuch a Covenant our Brethren ſay, is requiſite in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation. Neither as yet were there any particular Elders of the particular Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> conſtituted, nor do we finde it expreſſed how long after. If it had been ſaid, that they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, with the <hi>Elders of Jeruſalem,</hi> it had carried ſome probability.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57278:33"/>
Moreover, it could not be the communion of a particular Church, becauſe they had the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> in ſeveral compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. <hi>Breaking bread from houſe to houſe.</hi> Gods providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it ſo that the Chriſtian Church ſhould be (as I may ſay) at the very birth of it, Catholike, in regard of Officers and members, before any reduction into particular ſocieties under particular Officers. It was ſo, potentially, from the giving of the Apoſtles commiſſion, and now it is actually in the members as well as Officers, before their number could make up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations in ſeveral countries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Yea, but (ſaith he) it is not to the whole company of beleevers in the whole world, for ſuch a company they never ſaw nor knew, and therefore could not be added to them.</q> p. 270.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not requiſite they ſhould ſee or know them all by face, but know that there was, or was to be ſuch a company which was already begun. It is like every member of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> did never ſee or know all the <hi>myriads</hi> that were of that Church, nor do every member of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Congregation in <hi>London,</hi> know all the members thereof. A forreigner that is naturalized by Parliament, and ſo added to this Kingdom, did never ſee nor know all the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>Again 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Give no offence to the Iews, nor to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, nor to the Church of God.</hi> Where the word <hi>Church</hi> cannot ſignifie the Elect only, nor any particular Congregation or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but indefinitely it reacheth the whole body though in never ſo remote parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>M. <hi>Hooker</hi> excepteth againſt this proof, becauſe (ſaith he) the Church here ſpoken of, is contra-diſtinct to the Jews, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot comprehend the whole company of beleevers through the whole world, becauſe ſome beleevers were of the Jews. <hi>Surv.</hi> c. 15. p. 270.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, I finde <hi>Beza</hi> in his large notes upon the place, interpreting the Jews here ſpoken of, to be the beleeving Jews, and the Gentiles to be the beleeving Gentiles. <hi>Partibus ſubijcit totum.</hi> But then he croſſeth M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in making the Church an <hi>integrum,</hi> and Jews and Gentiles to be the integrant parts. Yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57278:34"/>
he adds as the more probable meaning, <hi>Niſi malimus iſtud Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dais &amp; Graecis de extrancis intelligere, quorum etiam nobis ſit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benda ratio,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And all others that I have met withall interpret the words of the unbeleeving Jews and Gentiles in oppoſition to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Or elſe of the beleeving Jews and Gentiles making one Church, but moſt in the firſt ſenſe. So <hi>Calvin, Iudaeos &amp; Gentes nominat, non tantum quia duobus illis generibus conſtabat Dei Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia, ſed ut doceat nos omnibus etiam alionis eſſe debitores, ut eos ſi fieri potest lucrifaciamus.</hi> So <hi>Paraeus</hi> on the verſ. Alſo <hi>Amb. Thomas Aqu. Goran,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh Annotations</hi> on the place. And the reaſon divers of them render is, becauſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Jews (abhorting Idols) might be beat off from Chriſt by ſeeing Chriſtians eating things ſacrificed to Idols: (which is the particular offence here mentioned by the Apoſtle) and the unbeleeving Gentiles might be confirmed in their Idolatry thereby: and the beleevers both of Jews and Gentiles take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Again (ſaith M. <hi>Hooker</hi>) that Church is here meant, whom a man may offend by his practice in the particulars mentioned: but he cannot offend the whole company of believers, through the whole world: becauſe a ſcandal muſt be ſeen or known certainly, &amp;c.</q>

So is this prohibition.</p>
                  <p>Some might give offence in one place, ſome in another, and ſome one in many places, in thoſe travelling times; and the whole was liable to offence, though haply not by one man, and therefore the object is ſet down indefinitely to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the whole. Yea, the word comprizeth not the Church <hi>Entitive,</hi> but <hi>Organical</hi> and <hi>combined,</hi> for they may ſo be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and we are not to affront or offend them: the greater the part of the whole body is, and the more compleated, the greater reſpect is to be had to it, that we give no offence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

This Evangelical Church is called <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and <hi>Sion</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. which text is parallel to this: and <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1, 2. <hi>the New Ieruſalem.</hi> The legal ceremonial ſervice did beget all under it to an <hi>external bondage,</hi> and brought them up under bondage; eſpecially hypocrites which were not led by the Law to Chriſt, but rather hindred from him, they were in <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> bondage.

It is by the preaching of the word, that children are begotten in her womb, the ſeed is the word: and by the ſame word as milk, and the uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, they are nouriſhed in their mothers houſe, and as a mother ſhe educates and rules them by diſcipline. And this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57278:35"/>
cannot be a particular Church, but muſt be the general, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith it is the <hi>mother of us all;</hi> the Apoſtle puts in himſelf and all beleevers. And the 27 <hi>verſ.</hi> makes it more plain, becauſe the Apoſtle confirms and explains himſelf by a quotation out of <hi>Iſa,</hi> 54. <hi>f.</hi> 2, 3. which ſheweth the calling in of the Gentiles to be of this Church. And thus all the proteſtant Expoſitours that I have met with, expound it. <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place ſaith, <hi>Caeleſtem vocat, non qua calo ſit incluſa, non quae ſit quaerenda extra mundum; eſt enim diffuſa Eccleſia per totum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem, &amp; in terra peregrinatur. Luther</hi> alſo ſaith, This heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which is above, is the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> the faithful diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed throughout the whole world, which have one and the ſame Goſpel, faith, Chriſt, holy Ghoſt, and Sacraments.—It is the Church which is now in the world, and not the Triumphant Church.—To be the mother of us all, it is neceſſary that this our mother ſhould be on earth among men, as alſo her gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is.—This ſpiritual Jeruſalem which took her beginning in corporeal Jeruſalem, hath not any certain place, but is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed throughout the whole world. This free mother is the Church it ſelf, the ſpouſe of Chriſt, of whom we are all gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. So <hi>Muſculus, Perkins, Baldwin,</hi> and <hi>Bullinger, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur de Eccleſia in terris ex omnibus gentibus collecta.</hi> It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other body which is correſpondent to <hi>Sarah,</hi> viz. the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church. <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> on <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.22. a text parallel to this hath theſe words, <hi>Caeleſtem Ieruſalem intelligit, quae per totum mundum extruenda erat, quemadmodum Angelus apud Zachariam funiculum ejus ab Oriente uſque in Occidentem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. <hi>To the intent that unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the Church, the manifold wiſedom of God.</hi> This Church was not a particular Congregatian, neither was it the Church of the elect, neither doth <hi>Beza</hi> ſo expound it (as is alledged) for he ſpeaks here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon of the government of it <hi>ſub variatâ Oeconomiâ:</hi> neither was the Church of the Gentiles only (which yet is more then one Congregation) neither can the circumſtances carry it ſo beyond control, as is alledged, becauſe of the <hi>myſteries</hi> here ſpoken of, that <q>
                        <hi>were kept ſecret ſince the beginning of the world,</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:57278:35"/>
and the <hi>multifarious wiſedom</hi> which was <hi>now made known by the Churches,</hi> but were before made known to the Church of the Jews, as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> conceives, p. 271.</q> For the myſteries revealed in the New Teſtament, were never known to the Jews before. <hi>Eye never ſaw them, nor ear heard them, nor entred it into the heart of man to conceive of them. But he that is leaſt in the kingdom of the Goſpel, knows more then Iohn the Baptiſt.</hi> But it was the Church-Catholike under the Goſpel, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> was made a Miniſter, as it is <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. It is that <hi>body of Christ, the Church, whereof Paul was made a Minister, as himſelf ſaith more fully,</hi> Col. 1.24, 25. which muſt needs be the <hi>external, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, organical,</hi> Catholike Church of Chriſt, conſiſting of Jew and Gentile.</p>
                  <p>Again it is ſaid in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers.</hi> The Church here ſpoken of, is <hi>not the Church Triumphant,</hi> for that hath no officers but Chriſt the head, there ſhall be no Paſtors and Teachers, <hi>quà ſuch,</hi> yet ſuch are in this Church <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. neither ſhall there be any gifts of healing, tongues, miracles, Deacons, or ruling Elders. Neither is it the <hi>Church as inviſible,</hi> conſiſting of the elect only: for the inviſible Church <hi>quâ</hi> inviſible, hath no Officers neither.</p>
                  <p>For though intentionally they are indeed given for the good of the Elect, yet they are ſet in the <hi>viſible Church.</hi> For both the ordinary and extraordinary Officers were viſible meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and ſome of them but viſible beleevers only, for <hi>Iudas had obtained part in the Apoſtleſhip and miniſtry,</hi> and was ſent to preach and work miracles: and many Prophets were not of the inviſible number: for <hi>many ſhall ſay, Lord, Lord, we have prophecied in thy name.</hi> &amp;c. and yet ſhall not be ſaved. But to be ſure they were ſent to afford the Saints viſible communion in Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>This is not meant of the Church entitive,</hi> which is a <hi>ſimilar,</hi> and (as I may ſay) an <hi>homogeneal</hi> body, every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as a member being equal, and of the ſame capacity: but it is meant of the <hi>Church Organical,</hi> an heterogeneal, diſſimilar body, becauſe here are ſet down the Officers. I mean <hi>diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and <hi>heterogeneal</hi> in regard of the <hi>integral</hi> parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57278:36"/>
Congregations, becauſe they all have or ought to have the ſame kinde of Officers and members, as ſo many flocks of ſheep under ſeveral ſhepherds. Therefore the ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches are called by ſome, an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: now the Epitome hath no other parts then the great body hath. <hi>Neither is here meant a particular Church,</hi> but all colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, that were within the bounds of the Apoſtles commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was the Church in the whole world, <hi>Go teach all nations,</hi> &amp;c. and all the Churches which have teachers over them, which all Churches in the world have, or ought to have, and yet all theſe are called but one Church, <hi>one body,</hi> verſ. 20. And this whole is one <hi>Organical body,</hi> v. 12. <hi>As we have many members in one body, and all members have not the ſame office: ſo we being many, are one body in Chriſt, and every one members one of another.</hi> Rom. 12.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath two Expoſitions of, or anſwers to this place. Firſt, that the Church here meant is <hi>totum univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale, exiſting and determinined in its actings by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That cannot be, for <hi>genus quâ genus</hi> can have no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, ſeeing it is a ſecond notion abſtracted only in the minde: therefore the Church <hi>quâ totum univerſale</hi> is no exiſting po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: if it hath Officers it muſt be conſidered as an <hi>integrum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>totum genenericum existens,</hi> it is nothing elſe (as I conceive) but <hi>integrum ſimilare.</hi> For <hi>genus</hi> exiſteth not as <hi>genus,</hi> but only under diſtinct ſpecifical forms, and is abſtracted from the <hi>species</hi> or individuals by the underſtanding. Now that which hath no exiſtence of its own, can have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting Officers. <hi>Omne conporeum exiſtens, vel eſt integrum, vel membrum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither will it help the cauſe at all to ſay, that <hi>Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Evangeliſts,</hi> were extraordinary temporary officers. Firſt, here are ordinary Officers inſerted alſo, given to the ſame Church, as <hi>Teachers, ruling-Elders, Deacons.</hi> Secondly, a <hi>genus</hi> admits of no variations in regard of time or place, or any other accidents: nothing extraordinary can betide a <hi>genus,</hi> but an <hi>integrum</hi> or exiſting being. <hi>Genus, ut eſt aeternae veritatis, ſic eſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57278:36"/>
aeternae identitatis. Genus</hi> is <hi>abſtractum quid, non concretum,</hi> but the Church-Catholike is <hi>concretum quid, &amp; conſtatum, &amp; ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatum ex membris, non ex ſpeciebus:</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed more fully afterwards.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Expoſition is, that <hi>the Apoſtle points at one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but includeth all particulars, by a parity and proportion of reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This cannot be; for this Church here meant is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical body of Chriſt, as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> himſelf expounds it, as I ſhewed before. Now all the members of a particular Church (as ſuppoſe Corinth) are but <hi>members of a part of that body,</hi> as I ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God did not ſet all theſe in every particular Church. Had every particular Congregation <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, miracles, gifts of healing, diverſities of tongues?</hi> yea, take the conſtant Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, the teacher, and ordinarily, one Congregation hath, not teachers, but only one teacher: therefore this parity of reaſon cannot hold, except all theſe Officers were in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in every Congregation. And if the Apoſtles, Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, were Officers of every particular Congregation, <hi>quâ</hi> particular, then all thoſe incongruities which our brethren bring againſt Presbyterial government; of choice, ordination, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, honour, from the particular Congregations to them; and their conſtant teaching, watching over, and ruling of them, fall directly upon theſe Officers. I ſuppoſe many Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons never had all theſe <hi>kindes</hi> of Officers among them. If it be meant diſtributively, ſome to one, ſome to another, then it ſhould have been ſaid <hi>Churches,</hi> not <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This place being a main fort that ſtood in M. <hi>Ellis</hi>'s way, he laies his main battety againſt it: and gives many anſwers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which yet are not <hi>ſubordinate</hi> or <hi>ſubſervient</hi> one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor yet <hi>conſiſtent</hi> one with another: but if any one will ſerve the turn to batter it down, it matters not (it ſeems) what become of the reſt. He parallels this place with <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4, 5. And ſaith, that <hi>one body</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> here and there ſpoken of, is meant in the ſame ſenſe that <hi>One faith, One Baptiſm</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> one in kinde: and as there are many ſingle faiths, hopes, baptiſms, though one in kinde, ſo there is one body in kinde,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57278:37"/>
but many ſingular bodies. <hi>vind.</hi> p. 34. But M. <hi>Ellis</hi> might have ſeen, that if he had run his parallel a little further, he had run over ſhoes and boots too. For there it is ſaid, that there is <hi>One Spirit, one Lord Jeſus, one God and Father,</hi> not in kinde, but in number; and why may not the Church, in which there is one individual doctrine of faith, and body of laws, and into which there is one manner of inrowlment by baptiſm, and in which only there is hope of ſalvation, be one numerically alſo: eſpecially conſidering that as the head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is one in number; ſo his body the Church can be but one in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo: For Chriſt hath not more bodies, in the ſame reſpect, then one.</p>
                  <p>But even his granting of a <hi>myſtical oneneſſe in Eſſence,</hi> drives him to <q>grant willingly, that this doth imply an union viſible alſo, as much as may ſtand with the institution of Chriſt, and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church, <hi>p. 34.</hi>
                     </q> And I think the Presbyterians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no more.</p>
                  <p>Alſo he ſaith, <q>the Church is one as the worſhip and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is one, <hi>viz.</hi> for nature and kinde, in the ſubſtantials of it, or that general platform of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but as the Church is not one viſible policy or corporation in number, ſo neither in outward government of it, <hi>vind.</hi> 35.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Presbyterians do acknowledge many diſtinct particular corporations of particular Churches, exerciſing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment actually and conſtantly by their own Officers. But as this oneneſſe in kinde of worſhip and government, giveth every private Chriſtian, whoſe conſtant actual exerciſe of publike worſhip is in one Congregation, an habitual right to worſhip God, and communicate in any (though never ſo far remote) Congregation, if occaſion ſerve: and makes him liable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs and ſuſpenſion there: if there be known cauſe; why ſhall not the Officers alſo whoſe conſtant actual exerciſe is but in one Congregation, have the like priviledge to exerciſe their office in any remote Congregation upon an occaſion, or call to it?</p>
                  <p>But there were two Objections <hi>vind.</hi> p. 35. which played ſo hard upon him, that they beat him from that battery, and therefore he betakes himſelf to another, mounted much higher.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57278:37"/>
                     <q>I grant (ſaith he) the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Church, whether viſible or inviſible, univerſal or particular, but not of it in theſe reſpects, but <hi>myſtically</hi> and <hi>totally,</hi> as comprehending thoſe in heaven alſo, and this ſenſe I will ſtick unto. <hi>pag.</hi> 35. Now in this <hi>body,</hi> or this <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Eph.</hi> 36. or in this fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heaven and earth, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 15 <hi>He hath ſet ſome Apoſtles, ſome Paſtors.</hi> Though they have exerciſe of their functions only, in that part which is on earth, and in that part of it on earth which is viſibles yet they are placed in the whole, <hi>pag.</hi> 36.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here M. <hi>Ellis</hi> grants more then was deſired. I fear this opinion will prove but a novel opinion: and he will have but few fellows to ſtand by him in managing this piece of battery. For as it expreſly croſſeth D. <hi>Ames</hi> before-cited, who ſaith, the Church-Catholike is one in regard of its external and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental ſtate, and not internal and eſſential: ſo it croſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who holdeth that the Officers of a particular Church <hi>are Officers only in their ſeverall Churches, vind.</hi> p. 8. therefore not ſet in the Church Triumphant. Certainly there they are where they were ſet, but they are in the Church viſible militant only: the Church Triumphant hath no Officers. This opinion will make all the Miniſters notable <hi>Non-reſidents,</hi> who never come at the place where they were ſet, all their life time. It were a happy turn for the Miniſters if they were all placed in the Church Triumphant as well as militant: I am ſure many of them will never come there. The Saints in heaven have no hand in the election of Officers here below, which by his arguing they ought to have, as well as the Church-Catholike in the election of every particular Officer. <hi>vind.</hi> p. 40. The Church in heaven have neither word, Sacraments, nor diſcipline, which are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the notes of the Church where the Miniſtery is placed. The Miniſters preach not to them, pray not with them, have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal communion with them, watch not over them, neither admoniſh nor cenſure them, not perform any part of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial office to them. Nay, the Officers are not ſo much as placed in the <hi>inviſible Church</hi> on earth; for as inviſible it hath no Officers, but as viſible only. It is true they are ſet for the good of the inviſible Church, and for the perfecting of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57278:38"/>
Triumphant, but they are ſet only in the viſible, and they are altogether viſible, and many of them only viſible, and yet are true Miniſters. Are the gifts of tongues, and of healing, and Deacons, ſet in the whole Church Triumphant, as well as Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant?</p>
                  <p>Are all that are baptized into one body, baptized into the Triumphant as well as militant? I think you will not ſay ſo, But how are we flown from a particular, viſible, congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, to the Triumphant on a ſudden, from one extream to another? Remember that of the Poet <hi>Ne ſi dimiſſior ibis, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nda graves pennas, ſi celſior, ignis adurat. Inter utrumque vola. Medio tutiſſimus ibis.</hi> It is clear the Apoſtle ſpeaks of that body wherein is ſuffering, and rejoycing one with another.

Some Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as their need ſhall require: yet not therefore making them one external ſociety (among themſelves) As ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers make not <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> M <hi>Ellis</hi> goes upon a miſtake in all his book. The Presbyterians ſay not that the Church-Catholike viſible is one external, <hi>conſtant, actual</hi> ſociety, but <hi>habitual;</hi> or <hi>in actu pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo:</hi> or <hi>conſtantly</hi> and <hi>actually, in actu ſecundo ſive exercite,</hi> the regiment is exerciſed in the particular Churches or vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: yet hath the whole Church, or ſome great parts of it: ſome common intereſts that may require to be handled in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Councels, by their combined or delegated Officers
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57278:39"/>
occaſionally: and thoſe Officers therein, act not as private men, but as Officers, and may exert their <hi>indefinite habitual</hi> power annexed to their office, for the good of the whole, or of ſo great a part of the Church-Catholike as did delegate them.</p>
                  <p>And as for the parallelling Apoſtles and Prophets in this caſe with life and death, it is not equal: for God did not ſet life and death as Officers in the Church, but they are general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents to the whole world, over-ruled by God for the good of his people. <hi>All things work together for the good of them that love him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in that he grants the word <hi>Church</hi> to extend to <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> and <hi>Epheſians,</hi> &amp;c. he muſt grant it to comprehend all the Churches as well as them, and that they all are one Church habitually, having then ſome general Officers over them, <hi>viz.</hi> Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts and Teachers, and the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, the ſame Prophet, and the ſame Teacher (if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired) in any of them.</p>
                  <p>But fearing he could not keep that battery, he retreats to a fourth, and ſaith, <q>that though by <hi>Church</hi> were meant the Church-Catholike viſible, yet it follows not that becauſe it was ſo then, and in reſpect of the Apoſtles, that therefore it was to be ſo to the end of the world, and in it ſelf.</q> pag. 37.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> it is true, it was not Chriſts minde that the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary office of Apoſtleſhip ſhould continue, there were to be no more ſuch men of extraordinary gifts, and divine immediate miſſion, of an infallible ſpirit, that had actual regiment over the Churches of the whole world, without any delegation from others, but by immediate commiſſion from Chriſt. But how comes that which was an <hi>integrum</hi> in the Apoſtles daies, to be now ſublimated into it <hi>genus,</hi> and loſe the integrality, and ſo prove a ſecond notion, exiſting only <hi>in intellectu nostro?</hi> Did it ceaſe to be one body as ſoon as the Apoſtles were all dead? ſeeing the ſame doctrine, worſhip laws, diſcipline, enrowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by baptiſm, confirmation and communion in the Lords Supper continued ſtill: and the liberty of all the members of the whole Church to communicate in theſe, in any place of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57278:39"/>
world, where they become (though but occaſionally) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill. And by the ſame reaſon the habitual power <hi>in actu primo</hi> which the Officers have to diſpenſe the Ordinances of God, may be drawn forth in any part of the Church, in <hi>actum ſecundum,</hi> upon an occaſion and call, <hi>according to their meaſure,</hi> which the Apoſtles had habitually and actually, every where, both in <hi>actu primo &amp; ſecundo,</hi> extraordinarily.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but (ſaith he) the Churches were not one in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but one in the Apoſtles, and that by accident, as <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were one in the King, becauſe he governed both; <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> in <hi>David:</hi> the whole world one in <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar.</hi> But they are not therefore one, conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Vind.</hi> p. 37.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant, the Church was but accidentally and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarily one in regard of the Apoſtles, but integrally one in it ſelf. It was not one, becauſe that <hi>they</hi> were ſet over it, but it was one in it ſelf integrally, becauſe Chriſt is ſet over it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they by commiſſion from Chriſt, were ſet over it extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, for the preſent good and neceſſity thereof. An Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire being made one under one Emperour, hath imperial laws and conſtitutions, which being divided under divers governours it loſeth again, and ceaſeth to be an Empire, but the Church hath the ſame laws under the ſame head that it had then, and ever ſhall have. The world was one Empire under <hi>Darius</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial laws, not becauſe the three Preſidents were ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, neither did it ceaſe to be ſo by their death or ceaſing. So <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But fifthly, ſaith he, though we grant, that while the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were living, there was one body of Officers over the whole Church, and ſo in reſpect of them the Church might be ſaid to be one <hi>governed</hi> body, yet it was never one <hi>governing</hi> body: for whileſt the Apoſtles lived, the univerſal governing power was committed to the Apoſtles only, and not with them to any other Officers or Churches; no not to all the Churches together, but they with their Officers were all in ſubjection to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I acknowledge the Church-Catholike was never <hi>one governing body:</hi> although M. <hi>Ellis</hi> is pleaſed to ſet down that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57278:40"/>
expreſſion in capital letters, in the frontiſpiece of his book, and upon the top of every page, and in divers other places, as the opinion of the Presbyterians. But where doth he finde any ſuch expreſſion in their writings? It may more truly be affirmed to be the opinion of ſome of our brethren of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational way, who put government into the body of the Congregation (whether M. <hi>Ellis</hi> be of that opinion or no, I cannot ſay) and ſo they are a particular governing body, and if all the Churches in the world were of that way (as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they deſire) and theſe Churches might in any ſenſe be called one Church (as is confeſt by all that they may) then they muſt needs be one governing body. But as they are now, they not only govern their own body, but paſſe the cenſure of <hi>Non-communion</hi> againſt all perſons, nay whole Churches, if they judge there be cauſe.</p>
                  <p>But the Presbyterians hold that governments belong to the Organs, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Officers of the Church, not to the body. It is for good of the body, but belongs not to the body to exerciſe. The Church-Catholike is the ſubject <hi>in quo exercetur,</hi> or <hi>cui da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non ad utendum, ſed ad fruendum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither are the Officers of the Church-Catholike one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant collective governing body actually, but habitually; for conſtantly and actually they are diſtributed into ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations for the exerciſe of government there. But if the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the whole (when it could be) or of any great part of the body, call the Officers of many particular Churches toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which may be by themſelves or their Commiſſioners) then can they exerciſe their office collectively <hi>conjunctim,</hi> yet only according to the word of God. And this M. <hi>Ellis</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in effect p. 7.8. only he ſaith their power being met, is only conſultatory and ſuaſory, not obligatory: it is the acting of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, but not as Officers: but I ſuppoſe he cannot think, that conſultatory and ſuaſory power, is ſufficient to cure the Church of the malady of obſtinate hereticks, whoſe mouths (ſaith the Apoſtle) muſt be ſtopped. And though the univerſal, conſtant, actual power of government was given to the Apoſtles only, yet we ſee they did joyn with the particular Elders in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Churches, when they were among them: and did
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57278:40"/>
alſo joyn them with themſelves in making decrees to binde the Churches. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.6. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4.</p>
                  <p>But fearing leſt he had granted ſomething too much in his former anſwer, he plucks away part of it in his ſixt, and ſaith, that the <hi>Apoſtles were not one joint Miniſtery.</hi> For beſides that each had intire power; ſome had one part committed to them, and ſome another, <hi>Thomas ſortitus eſt Parthiam, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas Scythiam Johannes Aſiam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtles did firſt act in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as one joint combined miniſtery: and did afterward diſperſe themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral parts of the world, according to their commiſſion, yet retained their power of uniting and acting together jointly without any delegation or commiſſion from any Churches, and this power of theirs no ordinary Miniſters lay claim to. And though the planting and watering of Churches required this diſperſion, and ſeveral lots voluntarily, yet were they fixed in no Congregation, as Elders are.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He denyeth the conſequence of a Church-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like viſible, from that place, and that he proves by a parallel, ſuppoſing ſuch like words had been ſaid of the whole world for civil government: his words are theſe; If it follow not, when we ſay God hath ſet in the world, ſome Emperors, ſome Kings, ſome Princes, ſome inferiour Officers and Magiſtrates, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world is but one governing Kingdom, and all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kingdoms do but govern in the right of the Kingdom of the world in common; the Officers whereof are the Kings of the ſeveral Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither doth it follow, that becauſe the Scripture ſaith, God hath ſet ſome in the Church, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore the Church throughout the world is but one Congregation, to whoſe Officers firſt, as the general Officers of the whole Church, not by way of diſtribution, but as a notionally (at leaſt) collected body of Officers, the power of government is committed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> He hath not paralleled the queſtion rightly, but it ſhould run thus. Suppoſe there were one Emperour over all the Kingdoms of the earth, and he ſhould ſet down one form of government and enrowlment for freedom in the whole world, for ſuch as will be his ſubjects, and ſhould firſt ſet 12
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57278:41"/>
Preſidents over the whole world, to abide ſo for their life time, as extaordinary Officers, and for ordinary ſtanding Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſhould ſet in the ſeveral Provinces or Kingdoms, ſeveral Officers that ſhould rule under him or them, in their ſeveral places: and yet appoint, that as every free member of the whole, though his fixed habitation be in one place, yet is free of the whole habitually, and upon occaſion can make uſe of it, to trade freely in any place: ſo the ſeveral governours, though ordinarily, fixedly and actually, they conſtantly govern their own Provinces, yet upon occaſion of difference, danger, or for the good of the whole, or any great part of the ſame, they ſhall have power to convene, either all, if it may be, or ſome of them by way of delegation, to act for the good of the whole, or ſo many Provinces as the matter concerns, and their delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is for. Whether would not this prove the world one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Empire, and body politick habitually? And ſo is the caſe of the Church-Catholike.</p>
                  <p>But take earthly monarchies as they have been on earth, and we finde that the ſeveral kingdoms of the Empires did enjoy their ſeveral liberties, with reſpect had to the whole, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be prejudicial to the Empire, that the Emperour <hi>ſhould have no damage,</hi> Dan. 6.2. And yet in reference to the Emperour, and ſome certain common laws, they were one monarchy. Becauſe the Emperour could ſend meſſengers and Officers of any countrey, and commands to them all, and all were to take care in their places for the whole (though haply there was no general convention of all Officers) and to keep as much as lay in them neighbour Kingdoms from rebelling, even where they had no ordinary jurisdiction, and to ſubdue them to the Emperour if they did rebel, and yet not retain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power over them. Now theſe things agree to this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual monarchy the Church; yea, and much more. For they are all one in the head, one in all the laws, and in one form of government; and ought all to do what they do in reference to the whole; as to admit every where into the whole by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to eject out of the whole by excommunication, to keep any neighbour Church from defection, and to reduce them if fallen off, though they have no ordinary jurisdiction over them.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57278:41"/>
Chriſt can ſend a Miniſter out of any Kingdom into any, not only occaſionally, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> as a meſſenger, but ſettle him there as an Officer, and call back or remove him any whither elſe. And therefore the Church-Catholike is one Kingdom in general, and yet particular rights and liberties of particular Churches be preſerved, ſo far as may ſtand with the good of the whole.</p>
                  <p>There is one Objection which M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in <hi>Surv.</hi> c. 15. p. 273. hath againſt this proof in this text, which is of ſome difficulty, <hi>vix.</hi> That Church where Deacons are ſet is not an unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church: But ordinary Deacons were ſet in the ſame Church wherein the Apoſtles were ſet, as in the place, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. it is affirmed jointly and indifferently of them both. Therefore that <hi>Church</hi> doth not argue an unlimited power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not affirmed that the Church-Catholike hath an unlimited power, but unlimited extent of the power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by Chriſt, in regard of place within the compaſſe of the Chriſtian world; and ſo I conceive M. <hi>Hookers</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is.</p>
                  <p>But to the Objection itſelf, Firſt I premiſe, that Deacons were not primarily ſet in a particular Congregational Church, but 7 of them were at the firſt inſtitution of the office ſet in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> over Jews and Grecians, where there were many Congregations, and therefore a Claſſical, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Church divided into many Congregations neceſſarily, at leaſt for ſome Ordinances (as the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet governed by one common Presbytery, and yet alwaies called one Church. But whether their Officers were fixed in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Congregations or no, I know not, neither do I think it can be proved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſubject about which their office was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, was not the Ordinances of worſhip or diſcipline, as the other offices were, but about alm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, which in their own nature are or ought to be, and were then, voluntary. And in regard thoſe alms come not by divine diſpenſation, as the immediate gift of Chriſt to the Church, though they be commanded indeed by Chriſt, but out of mens purſes by contribution, being a money
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57278:42"/>
matter, in which the Congregation hath, or had propriety, there may be ſomething ſaid for the limitation of that office in their act of ordinary diſtribution to the members of that ſingle or combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Church contributing, that it may be performed according to the will of the donors, to whom alſo the Deacons are to render an account.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I deſire the manner of the Apoſtles ſpeech in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down Deacons and governours, may be conſidered, not adding an ordinal numeral unto it, as to Apoſtles, Prophets and Teachers, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>deinde:</hi> and 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. interpoſing 2 extraordinary endowments of miracles, and gifts of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and 3. the change of ſpeech from the concrete to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, <hi>helps, governments.</hi> Which though they imply men by whom they are to be exerciſed, <hi>viz.</hi> helpers and governours, yet are not ſo ſet down: what the meaning of the holy Ghoſt is herein I cannot affirm, but I conceive that the office of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Prophets, Teachers, is of ſomewhat more large extent then the other two, becauſe they were executed as well without the Church (though ſet in it) as within it, <hi>viz.</hi> among hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens for their converſion: And in <hi>Eccleſia conſtituendâ,</hi> the other in <hi>conſtitutâ</hi> only: and the exerting of the Deacons office not ſo uſually and frequently out of the limits of their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, as theirs that are intruſted with the preaching of the word: nor yet their call thereunto ſo facil as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for to the exerting of government there is required a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary combination of many inſtituted Churches, and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution to other Churches there is required a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary neceſſity, and the conſent of the particular Church contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting: but no ſuch ſolemn call is required to the preaching the word in any other Church or Churches.</p>
                  <p>But fourthly, more directly to the Objection: Though alms, which is the ſubject of the Deacons office, be not reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ordinances given by Chriſt, but are the gift of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men in particular Congregations, as the reſt of them: yet the neceſſity, command, and diſtribution of them, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend further then the particular Church, and in that regard the office of Deacons, which is to collect and diſtribute, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf equally. We are bidden to <hi>do good to all, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57278:42"/>
to the houſhold of faith</hi> (i. e. as we have occaſion and ability) which is as extenſive as the Church-Catholike. Any forreign Church may ſtand in need of our contribution and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution. And even the Law of our land enjoyneth, that if any Congregation cannot maintain their poor, there ſhould be help by collections from other neighbouring Congregations. And the maimed ſouldiers of the whole County are maintained by conſtant collection from every town in the County, and there are County Treaſurers that receive it, which are (as it were) County-Deacons. And if a great Town be viſited with the plague, or ſuffer loſſes by fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is frequent to make collections for them in many Countries. Yea, for whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as the whole Kingdom, hath lately done for <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi> yea, for a whole Kingdom, as for our own Kingdom under war; yea, for forreign Kingdoms, as <hi>England,</hi> yea, and the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> (though under another civil regiment) have done for <hi>Ireland.</hi> And we reade what the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> did for the Churches of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And we have had contribution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem captivated Chriſtians under the <hi>Turk,</hi> and not only of our own Nation, but other Nations, ſometimes <hi>Grecians.</hi> Now though theſe contributions and collections run among us in another channel, <hi>viz.</hi> through the hands of Church-wardens, Overſeers, Conſtables, Collectors, yet this is the proper work of the Deacons; and therefore that office in regard of the extent of their poſſible object, may well be ſaid to be habitually Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, or given to the Church-Catholike, though their conſtant diſtribution ſhould be limited to their own Congregations.</p>
                  <p>Another proof is from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe things I write unto thee, that thou maist know how thou oughteſt to behave thy ſelf in the houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</hi> This Church muſt be the viſible Church where he and others muſt exiſt, and converſe together, and carry themſelves in mutual duties. Alſo it muſt be an organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church, for the Epiſtle containeth directions about Biſhops and Deacons, yea, even in the context. Neither can the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be ſolely concerning <hi>Epheſus;</hi> for they are written to <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangeliſt, the limits of whoſe office are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable to the Apoſtles, though under them. Neither do they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57278:43"/>
concern Epheſus in any eſpecially manner, but all Churches where ever <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould come. Therefore not to it particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. For he preſcribeth canons concerning publike praier: and the habit and carriage of women in the Church: concerning the office of Biſhops and Deacons: concerning the cenſuring and reproof of all degrees; the Ordination and maintenance of Elders: the choice and proviſion for widows: concerning the duties of ſervants: and a charge to rich men, not of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> particularly or only, but every where. Neither did they concern <hi>Epheſus</hi> primarily; for the Officers were already ſet in that Church; <hi>Paul</hi> found Elders there <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17. in his viſitation of them, and had lived there three years, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. as himſelf acknowledgeth. Primarily therefore theſe canons concern the whole Church. The manner alſo of the Apoſtles ſpeech is to be attended; he doth not ſay <hi>the Churches, houſes, pillars, grounds,</hi> to be ordered <hi>pari rattoni;</hi> but in the ſingular number <hi>houſe, church, pillar, ground,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as if there were but <hi>one Church, one houſe</hi> (whereof <hi>Epheſus</hi> was but <hi>one room,</hi> and that already furniſhed) <hi>one ſeat, one large pillar,</hi> that hath the ſame truth written on every ſide of it, which holdeth it forth unto others, both Jews and Gentiles, within the Church and without, <hi>more forenſi.</hi> And as <hi>Timothy</hi> being an Evangeliſt converſed with many Churches, ſo it is like did the members of the Church of <hi>Epheſus. The Engliſh Annotations on this place are theſe.</hi> "As the Catholike Church is, as it were, "the whole houſe of God; ſo every particular Church as this of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was, in which <hi>Timothy</hi> reſided, was a part thereof, and by a Synecdoche <hi>(totius)</hi> may be called the houſe of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The words alſo of the following verſe will lend us ſome light, <hi>Great is the myſtery of go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lineſſe: God manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, beleeved on in the world, received up into glory.</hi> This is the truth ſupported by this ſeat, and holden forth by this pillar. Doth this concern <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſolely, or particularly, or primarily? Is there not a larger ſubject expreſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and the believing world? All theſe are the family and houſhold of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. and 3.15.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is the Catholike viſible Church that is ſo often in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57278:43"/>
Scripture called the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 4.26, 30. And the <hi>Kingdom of heaven,</hi> Mat. 13.24, 31, 33, 47. Chriſt cals them not Kingdoms but the Kingdom. And compares this Kingdom to a <hi>field of wheat mingled with tares,</hi> This muſt be the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in this world, becauſe it is where the ſower ordinarily ſoweth his ſeed viſibly and audibly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. which is the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word. And becauſe here are good and bad, wheat and tares, and the tares viſibly diſcerned after the wheat. And it is the Catholike Church, for Chriſt himſelf expounds it ſo, <hi>the field is the world,</hi> not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and 17.11, 15. And this muſt be the Chriſtian world; for the other is a field of tares only, where there could be no danger of plucking up of wheat, becauſe none grew there. They ſhall fever the wicked from among the juſt. And in this field, particular Churches are but as particular rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, enjoying the ſame tillage, ſeed, fencing, watering. <hi>It is a barn floor with wheat and chaffe. It is a draw net, gathering together good and bad. It is a marriage, where wiſe and fooliſh virgins, ſome had oil, and ſome only lamps of profeſſion, It is a feaſt where ſome had wedding garments, ſome had none.</hi> Now theſe things cannot be ſpoken ſolely, or primarily of any particular Congregation, but they agree to the Church-Catholike viſible, this Kingdom is here ſpoken of as one; and to particular Churches as parts thereof: and this is alſo an organical body, therefore called a Kingdom. Here are ſervants ſowing and viewing this field, proffering to weed it. And this weeding muſt be by Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical cenſures, not the civil ſword; they were not ſo void of reaſon as to go ask whether they ſhould kill all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the godly, with a civil ſword: then theſe tares muſt be members of the Church, elſe they were not capable to be caſt out, if never in. Here were fiſhermen (officers) that caſt this net: and ſervants that invited theſe gueſts, every where in high waies and hedges, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.23. indefinitely, without reſpect of Countrey or Town.</p>
                  <p>That which is objected againſt this by M. <hi>Hooker</hi> is, <q>that <hi>the Kingdom of heaven</hi> beſide other ſignifications, as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it doth by a <hi>metonymy</hi> imply the word of the Kingdom, and the diſpenſation and adminiſtration
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57278:44"/>
of the Goſpel in the Churches, and the ſpecial things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining thereunto. And citeth theſe parables for that ſenſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny not the ſeveral ſignifications of thoſe words, <hi>the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>everal places. But they cannot ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſo in the fore-ceited places. For it is ſaid, <hi>the Angels ſhall gather out of his</hi> (Chriſts) <hi>Kingdom, all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and ſhall caſt them,</hi> &amp;c. can this be meant of the <hi>word or Goſpel?</hi> Is there any thing that offends therein, or doth iniquity that ſhall be caſt, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Is there any tares, any chaff, any rubbiſh there? Or can it be meant of <hi>the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation thereof?</hi> Should ſinful or erroneous diſpenſations of Gods Ordinances be ſuffered to the end of the world, for fear of plucking up good diſpenſations? Why do we then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a reformation? Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay falſe teachers mouths muſt be ſtopped, and wiſheth ſuch cut off?</p>
                  <p>It is clear the texts ſpeak of a Kingdom conſiſting of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the tares, chaffe, rubbiſh, fooliſh virgins, and evil gueſts, <hi>are the children of the wicked one, man that offend, and doe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that ſhall be gathered out of Christs Kingdom,</hi> therefore they were in it. And the wheat, good fiſh, wiſe virgins, and good gueſts, are <hi>the children of the Kingdom,</hi> without reſpect to any particularities, of Town or Countrey, much leſſe of any Congregation.</p>
                  <p>And when we ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> we pray not only for the converſion of the elect, nor only for the coming of the Kingdom of glory, but alſo for the Church-Catholike viſible, that it might be enlarged, and have freedom and purity of Ordinances, which are things that concern it as a viſible, organical Kingdom, becauſe the diſpenſations thereof are by Officers.</p>
                  <p>Again in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. it is ſaid, <hi>Then ſhall Chriſt deliver up the Kingdom to God his Father.</hi> This is not the natural or <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Kingdom,</hi> which he hath with the Father and holy Ghoſt as God: for that he ſhall never deliver up. Neither is it the <hi>Kingdom of grace</hi> which he by his Spirit exerciſeth in the hearts of the Elect, for that ſhall continue for ever, and be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in heaven. For the Kingdom of grace here, and of glory
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57278:44"/>
afterward, differ only <hi>gradis communionis,</hi> as <hi>Ames</hi> tels us; here the degree is imperfect, then it ſhall be perfect, both in graces and joyes. <hi>But it is the Kingdom exerciſed in the viſible Church-Catholike, in the Ordinances of worſhip and diſcipline,</hi> wherein our communion is mediate with God, which ſhall then ceaſe. For as the Evangelical external ſervice and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of communion with God, thruſt out the legal and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial: ſo ſhall the heavenly immediate, thruſt out the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical.</p>
                  <p>But this Kingdom (ſaith M. <hi>Hooker</hi>) cannot be the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like viſible Church, becauſe that conſiſting of ſound-hearted Chriſtians and falſe-hearted hypocrites, theſe are not delivered up into the hand of the Father, that he might be all in all to them. <hi>Surv.</hi> p. 276.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not conceive by <hi>Kingdom</hi> to be meant the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom, but the external donative regiment of Chriſt over his viſible Church-Catholike diſpenſed by Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Officers here below, which ſhall then ceaſe. And <q>though the Ordinances (as he alledgeth) are diſtinct from the Kingdom in ſenſe and ſignification.</q> Yet they ſtrongly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a Kingdom conſtituted and governed by them: as the Kings laws argue a King and Kingdom. As from <hi>helps</hi> and <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. we gather the conſequence of <hi>helpers</hi> and <hi>governours,</hi> as officers in the Church: ſo from the external laws of this Kingdom, we neceſſarily conclude there is ſuch a Kingdom, commenſurable to the extent of theſe laws, and that <hi>external, Organical</hi> and <hi>Catholike,</hi> which is ſpoken of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. And the 25. <hi>ver.</hi> makes it plain, <hi>for he muſt reign until he hath put all enemies under his feet:</hi> which reigning relates to profeſſed Subjects as well as profeſſed enemies; and theſe Subjects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in a Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Again <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may ſerve God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</hi> This Kingdom cannot be meant of the <hi>internal Kingdom of grace</hi> in the heart, for that was alſo exerciſed by Chriſt in his peoples hearts, under the old Teſtament, but it is meant of the external, unalterable, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Ordinances of worſhip and government, which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57278:45"/>
from thoſe under the Law: elſe the Apoſtles <hi>antitheſis</hi> of the Church under the Law, and the Church under the Goſpel, had not been good, which are the things he compares in that place. Externals under the Law are oppoſed to externals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. It cannot be meant of the <hi>Kingdom of glory,</hi> for they had not yet received that. And it is plain he ſpeaks of a Kingdom wherein we may <hi>now ſerve God acceptably, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and godly fear.</hi> Now theſe Ordinances of worſhip and diſcipline being Catholike or univerſal, and relating to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and therefore ſet down under the name of a kingdom, by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>ſubject</hi> for the <hi>adjunct,</hi> the Kingdom for the Ordinances of the Kingdom, do ſtrongly argue the being of the Kingdom. Can we conceive that the holy Ghoſt would chuſe to uſe ſuch a <hi>metonymy</hi> of the <hi>ſubject,</hi> where there is <hi>no ſuch ſubject?</hi> It is true (as is alledged) the unalterableneſſe lyeth in the adjunct Ordinances, <hi>i. e.</hi> in regard of God, who will not alter them: and that the ſubject or kingdom may be moved and ſhaken by perſecutions or hereſies, and ſo may the Ordinances alſo, and have been we know; but that kinde of alteration, moving, or ſhaking, is not meant in the text, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was intended by me. I have the rather mentioned this text, becauſe I finde one of our brethren for Congregational Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> M. <hi>William Sedgwick,</hi> giving this Expoſition of it in a Sermon of his in print, which was preached before divers members of the Houſe of Commons.</p>

It is therefore the militant viſible Church which holdeth forth the truth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.16. contending for it, <hi>Jude</hi> 3.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> O but this place is meant only of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, for they that are only viſible may be prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that any particular meerly viſible member may be prevailed againſt, yet all ſhall not; and even the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible members which cannot be prevailed againſt (ſo many as are left in any, though never ſo general and fierce perſecution) ſhall remain as viſible. For <hi>Eccleſia nunquam definit eſſe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis.</hi> Therefore Satan or men ſhall never ſo far prevail, as to cut off all viſible members. And though hereſies ſhould come that deceive all but the elect (which is not ſuppoſable) yet as long as the Elect are not deceived, there remaineth a Church Catholike viſible, ſtill in their viſibility. But it cannot be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that all are inviſible members that are left, or hold
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57278:46"/>
out in the hotteſt perſecutions, or ſubtleſt hereſies: ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightnings and covictions, and ſtruglings of conſcience, and other by-ends may do much. Latent members may not be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>But the reaſons which induce me to think that this text is meant of the Church viſible, are theſe; two I finde in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. Firſt, becauſe this Church is built upon this viſible or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible profeſſion, <hi>that Chriſt is the ſonne of God,</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> made; The rock there ſpoken of, is not an indefinite <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come, for ſo the Church from the beginning of the world was built on that work: but the profeſſion and doctrine that the <hi>Meſſiah is already come,</hi> that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and this <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is the ſonne of God. It is the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.2, 3. And the beleeving that I am he (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.24. And therefore the Jews that believed before in an indefinite <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come, were upon their converſion to the Chriſtian faith built upon this rock, and by a new Sacrament admitted into this Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, as well as the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe Chriſt immediatly in the next verſe affixeth officers to this Church, by promiſing the keys of the Kingdom of heaven unto <hi>Peter</hi> (and not to him only but to the reſt alſo, as appears in other places) which keys are an Enſign of office in that Church which Chriſt would build.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the admiſſion into this Evangelical Church was upon a viſible profeſſion of their belief of this doctrine, and a viſible receiving of a viſible external badg of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe this Church is aſſaulted by viſible adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>viz.</hi> perſecutors and hereticks, and that viſibly: and though they ſhall never wholly prevail againſt it, yet viſibly waſte great part of it many times.</p>
                  <p>And M. <hi>Hooker</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth that he doth incline to this judgement of this text, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is the viſible Church that is there meant. <hi>Surv.</hi> c. 15. p. 278.</p>
                  <p>Only he objecteth againſt a reaſon which I brought of it, which was to this purpoſe. If all the viſible members ſhould fail, then all the inviſible muſt needs fail alſo, for none are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57278:47"/>
(in the Church I mean) but muſt be viſible alſo. His Objection againſt this is, becauſe an inviſible member may be juſtly excommunicated, and ſo caſt out of all the viſible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the world, and ſo be no viſible member, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main an inviſible member ſtill, for that memberſhip cannot be loſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very doubtful to me how far excommunication caſteth a man out of the viſible Church; it debars him indeed from the Lords Supper, becauſe it is a ſeal; and from familiar intimate ſociety with Gods people, becauſe he is an infected member, and ſo doth a notorious ſinne, though the man be not excommunicated. But I conceive it cuts him not off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally from the viſible Church; For firſt, the ſeal of baptiſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth on him, and therefore is not iterated at his readmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, he is admitted to hearing the word, and prayer, and conference with Gods people. He is a diſeaſed leprous member under cenſure, ſhut from the moſt intimate actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, until he be cured and cleanſed. That which is done to him is under conſideration of diſcipline, as to a member now diſeaſed, in order to cure, not as to one that is damned, or to one that is under the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate was. And if any godly perſon through weakneſſe of judgement concerning Churches not rightly gathered, refuſe to be baptized (as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſuggeſteth) he is indeed no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat member in that regard, but he being converted by viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means, and making viſible profeſſion, he is an incompleat viſible member of the Church-Catholike Entitive.</p>
                  <p>Again, Excommunication in 3 Ep. <hi>Joh.</hi> ver. 10. is called <hi>caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Church,</hi> What Church is that? It cannot be the inviſible Church, for all the cenſures in the world cannot caſt a man out of that, if once he be in; therefore it is the viſible Church. Then I would know whether a man truly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in one Church or Congregation, is not thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated from brotherly fellowſhip with all Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, yea, and Chriſtians not gathered yet into Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Or whether the delivering up to Satan, by the Officers of a particular Congregation, be only within the bounds of one Congregation, or in reference to their members only;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57278:47"/>
ſo that if he remove out of ſuch a <hi>circle</hi> or <hi>circuit</hi> of ground to another, or from thoſe members to others, he be out of Satans bonds again, and may communicate there <hi>de jure?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This M. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith, is <hi>per Synecdochen generis pro Specie,</hi> that particular Church where <hi>Diotrephes</hi> uſurped prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is underſtood. For when a perſon is juſtly excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from the Congregation in which he was, it follows of neceſſity that all that fellowſhip he might enjoy by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of communion of Churches, muſt of that neceſſity be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied unto him, and he juſtly deprived thereof, becauſe in the vertue of his fellowſhip with one, he gained fellowſhip with others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether the word <hi>Church</hi> be there properly, or <hi>per Synecdochen generis,</hi> or <hi>Synecdochen Integri,</hi> I ſhall not now enquire but refer it to a Chapter by it ſelf, in which ſhall be enquired whether the Church-Catholike be a <hi>genus</hi> or <hi>integrum.</hi> But I queſtion much whether a mans fellowſhip with one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation be the ground whereby he gaineth fellowſhip and communion with others. For then how came the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts by right of communion with any Churches, ſeeing they were fixed members of none? And how could the 120. and 3000. converted by <hi>Peter</hi> have right of communion, and breaking bread together, before any Congregations were ſet up or ſetled? Therefore I conceive the primary right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is gained by being of the viſible body, not by being of this or that Congregation, By being within the general Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not by any particular Covenant. And I conceive, that Baptiſm and Excommunication run parallel herein; for as by Baptiſm a man is admitted externally into the whole viſible body, and then may have fellowſhip with any part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: ſo by Excommunication a man is caſt out from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the whole, and therefore may communicate with no part. This is <hi>Apollonius</hi> his aſſertion. <hi>Sicut per Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem legitimam excommunicatus non tantum ex hac vel illa particulari Eccleſia ejicitur, ſed ubicunque terrarum ligatur, &amp; ex communione fraeternâ univerſalis Eccleſiae exeluditur.</hi> Mat. 18.17, 18. <hi>Ita &amp; per Sacramentum Baptiſmi, &amp; ſacrae Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtiae,

                  <p>And though the power of Excommunication lyeth in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation, where a perſon enjoies his memberſhip under the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith, yet the Officers of that particular Church diſpenſe that cenſure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the whole body, whereof he that is ſo cenſured was a member, as well as of that Congregation, for being caſt out of that, let him be or go where he will, he is under the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Satan, and all Churches ſhould look at him as a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour againſt Chriſt, and ſo deal with him as one uncapable of Church-communion. <hi>Surv.</hi> c. 15.</p>
                  <p>So on the contrary, though Baptiſm be adminiſtred in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation, yet a man ſo admitted in any Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to be counted a ſubject to Chriſt, and not to be denied fellowſhip in any other Congregation, being a member of the viſible body, except he ſome way forfeit his right. So that both admiſſion into, and ejection out of the Church, though performed by Officers in a particular Congregation, yet relate firſt to the whole body.</p>

                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note>THe firſt Argument is from Gods donation unto Chriſt, and it ſtands thus. If the donation of a Kingdom by God the Father unto Jeſus Chriſt be univerſal and Oecumenical, then his Kingdom (which is his Church) is alſo univerſal and Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical. But the donation was of an univerſal Oecumenical King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Therefore there is ſuch an univerſal Oecumenical King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Church.</p>
                  <p>The major propoſition is clear: for whatſoever God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave or promiſed unto Jeſus Chriſt, that he performed. The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57278:48"/>
minor or aſſumption is proved out of divers places of Scripture. As <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> Which is ſpoken of the donative Kingdome of Chriſt given to him at his asking, and not the eſſential or natural Kingdom as God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.8. <hi>He ſhall have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</hi> Where is mentioned the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal worſhip and offerings given unto him. The like promiſe we finde <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. <hi>It is a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt raiſe up the Tribes of Iacob, I will give thee for a light unto the Gentiles, that thou maist be my ſalvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> Alſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 7 14. <hi>And there was given unto him</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all people, nations and languages ſhould ſerve him, his dominion is an everlaſting dominion, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed:</hi> Which is meant of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Kingdom given to Chriſt incarnate at his aſcention, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. where the officers of his Kingdom are ſet down. And to <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 9. This is not only the internal Kingdom in the heart, for that he exerciſed from the beginning, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an external Kingdom, or Church politie over all nations, after the ruine of the four Monarchies, which ſhould be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed over thoſe Kingdoms which formerly were ſubject to thoſe Monarchies: which Kingdom is that little ſtone cut out of the mountain without hands, which became a great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and filled the whole earth, which the God of heaven ſhould ſet up viſibly in the ſtead of thoſe Monarchies. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. not in a civil power of this world, but in ſpiritual and divine Ordinances, which all Kingdoms that ſhould be converted to the Chriſtian faith ſhould ſubmit themſelves unto. And this one mountain filling the whole earth, muſt needs be one Church-Catholike viſible, ſubmitting viſibly to Chriſt. 2. If Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in ſending Chriſt, and the tenour of Gods donation, and exhibition of Chriſt, and redemption by Chriſt in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, be general to the whole world, then the viſible Church is to be Catholike. But the former is true, and therefore ſo is the latter. I mean by <hi>general, Generibus ſingulorum, non ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis generum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The donation of Chriſt and redemption by him was not to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57278:49"/>
the Jews only (as the Jews conceived) but to the whole world. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world</hi> (not the Jews only) <hi>that he gave his only begotten ſonne, that whoſoever belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life,</hi> i. e. that whoſoever in any part of the world, of what nation ſoever, ſhould beleeve, ſhould have everlaſting life, <hi>That the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> verſ. 17. The Antitheſis is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>elect</hi> and <hi>reprobate,</hi> that whoſoever of the elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, as the <hi>Arminians</hi> make our ſenſe of the words to runne ridiculouſly (though I confeſſe the elect only do truly beleeve) but it is between the <hi>Iew</hi> and the <hi>reſt of the world.</hi> So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.42. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.33.51. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>The Saviour of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now though many of the benefits purchaſed by Chriſt for his elect be ſpiritual and inviſible, and obtained only by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible company, yet Chriſt himſelf and his death were viſible, his righteouſneſſe viſibly performed, his active and paſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were viſible, and multitude of benefits that the external Catholike Church receive thereby are viſible.</p>

If there be any particular Charter by which any particular Church was conſtituted beſide the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, let that be produced, I know none. For if there were, then that particular viſible Church could never fail, or elſe a Goſpel Charter muſt be loſt. But all particular Churches hold their priviledges by the general Covenant applied to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as all the twelve Tribes did theirs by the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed.

Firſt, miſtakes my words and meaning, for whereas I proved the univerſality of their office from the unlimitedneſſe of it, he conceives it of having no limits in their works, and ſo ſet down, but I meant no limits in regard of places. And then he ſaith the reaſon of their unlimitedneſſe aroſe from their <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> becauſe it was general, being immediatly called by God to preach to all nations, and they had vertually all Church-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in them, but this did not iſſue nextly from the Church in which they were firſtly ſet.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. If there be a general, external vocation, wherewith all Chriſtians are called, and a general external Covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into all Chriſtians voluntarily and externally enter, and are therein bound up in an unity, then there is a general external Catholike Church.

                  </p>
                  <p>The minor appears as evidently: For firſt, there is but one external general vocation divine, diſtinct from all other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular vocations, not only civil bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The conſequence of the major appears, becauſe this fraternal union ariſeth from the unity of the Church, which is conſtituted by one Covenant, into which they are all entred viſibly. They are not made brethren by being inviſible believers only, or in the ſame reſpect for then only inviſible believers were bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the Scripture ſenſe.

And it is the moſt uſual term, that the Chriſtians were called by, both in the <hi>Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> and in the <hi>Epiſtles;</hi> not becauſe they were of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation, but becauſe of the Church-Catholike, which are alſo called the houſhold of faith. <hi>Doe good unto all</hi> (i. e. though heathens) <hi>but especially to the houſhold of faith.</hi> Gal. 6.10. The houſhold is commmenſurable to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the faith. Not the inviſible members only, for they could not be known as ſuch, but all the viſible members.</p>
                  <p n="9">9.

                  <p>The minor is undeniable. For the ſame individual ſyſteme expreſſed in the Goſpel <hi>totidem verbis</hi> governs and guides the whole Catholike Church, It cannot be ſaid the ſame in kinde

only, but the ſame for matter, manner, end, method, and expreſſe words: unleſſe we can ſay the ſeveral copies are ſeveral <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and then we in <hi>England</hi> have ſo many <hi>ſpecies</hi> of laws as there be copies printed of our laws.

Neither is it the moral law <hi>quâ</hi> moral, but that in the hand of a Mediatour, with other poſitive laws added thereto.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this ſubjection unto theſe external laws arbitrary by the concurrent conſent of divers Churches out of cuſtome, or becauſe of the equity and conveniency of them, <hi>vi materiae,</hi> as divers Kingdoms now uſe the civil laws, or for intercourſe with forreign Churches; but by vertue of the command of the authour of them. Neither have particular Churches any muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal laws divine of their own ſuperadded to diſtinguiſh them, as <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> have, but are wholly ruled by this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike ſyſteme.</p>

And yet were not of one particular Church, not as our brethren themſelves tell us, as I ſhewed before, therefore as members in general. And nothing is more uſual then for members of one Congregation to joyn in the fellowſhip of the word read and preached, in ſinging and prayer with members of divers Congregations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as at lectures or other occaſions, and frequently alſo at the Lords table, even among our brethren in <hi>New-England,</hi> members of far diſtant Congregations do communicate occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally. Alſo all the viſible Churches on earth pray publikely, and give thanks, and on occaſion may faſt for the welfare of the whole Church on earth.</p>
                  <p>As for the evaſion which ſome of our brethren have, that this communion of ſtrangers with them is by vertue of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, preſent, tranſient memberſhip with them; I conceive it of no force, nor warranted in the word of God. Then ſhould thoſe men be members of two Churches at once, then ought they to contribute to that Miniſter, then ought that Miniſter to take the charge of them, then (by ſome of our brethrens poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) ſhould the whole Congregation have a hand in their admiſſion. Alſo if there be any Eccleſiaſtical admiſſions or cenſures or tranſactions, or contributions that concern that particular Congregation, they alſo ought being members to have their vote and conſent and hand therein. And then by the ſame reaſon all that came to a lecture which is a Church-fellowſhip in divine Ordinances of ſinging, praier, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bleſſing the people, muſt ſo many times turn mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Congregation, where ſuch a meeting is. And then is it a dangerous thing to hear a lecture in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation where the Miniſter or people are corrupt, for we thereby make our ſelves members of that Congregation, and ſo put our ſelves under that Paſtour and thoſe Elders for the preſent, and thereby give our allowance of them.

                  <p n="3">3. Nay, it appears further to be an integral, becauſe it is made up not only of the particular Congregations, but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Chriſtians, not only ſuch as are particular members of particular Congregations, but ſuch as are not members of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57278:56"/>
any particular Congregation, as I ſuppoſe all Chriſtians are not fixed members, nor can be, as I could give divers inſtances, as in regard of habitation, perigrination, baniſhment, want of opportunity, ſcrupuloſity. If ſuch be not members of the Church-Catholike becauſe not fixed, then the Apoſtles themſelves and Evangeliſts were none, for they were not fixed: but we finde that they were not only members, but officers, and ſo related to the body as organical. A Corporation or City conſiſteth not only of ſtreets, wards, and companies, but of perſons within their liberties though dwelling alone. Now if the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike be a <hi>genus,</hi> it cannot be abſtracted from them both, if it be abſtracted from particular Congregations, and ſo be a <hi>genus</hi> of ſocieties and polities, then it doth not contain ſuch as are not in any ſocieties or polities: if it be abſtracted from them as particular unfixed members, then it is no <hi>genus</hi> of particular Churches, for they are none, nor of any. But as the Church is an <hi>integrum</hi> it may be made up of both, and reſult out of both.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That which hath inherent accidents and adjuncts exiſting in it, as its own, that is an integral, for a <hi>genus</hi> is not capable of them: But the Church-Catholike viſible hath accidents inhaering, adhaering, and betiding unto it and exiſting in it. Therefore it is an integral.</p>
                  <p>The major is undeniable. The minor appeareth by inſtance. Beauty, ſtrength, offenſive, defenſive, purity, terribleneſſe with banners (<hi>viz.</hi> of diſcipline) conſpicuity, order, viſibility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are accidents that may and ſometimes have been, and ſome of them are ſtill exiſting in the whole Church, as belonging to the whole: therefore it is an integral.</p>
                  <p>Again, That which is capable of being <hi>majus</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> i. e. is ſometimes greater and ſometimes leſſe in extent, that is an integral, but ſo is the Church-Catholike or Oecumenical. The conſequence is clear, becauſe a <hi>Genus</hi> can neither be greater or leſſe then it ever was. <hi>Animal</hi> was as great a <hi>Genus</hi> when there were but two men, and a few beaſts in the world, as it is now there are many millions: for the greatneſſe of the <hi>genus</hi> is not meaſured by continuous or diſcreet quantity; but the nearer <hi>Ens</hi> it is, and the further from Individuals, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the <hi>Genus</hi> is, <hi>i. e.</hi> the more comprehenſive; and the further
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57278:56"/>
remote from <hi>Ens,</hi> and the nearer the Individuals, the leſſe the <hi>Genus</hi> is, <hi>i. e.</hi> the leſſe comprehenſive. But the Oecumenical Church is meaſured by quantity continuous in regard of place wherein it is, and diſcrete in regard of number of the Churches and members thereof: ſometimes the bounds thereof are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and ſometimes ſtreightned. There is an augmentation by addition of members, a diminution by ſubſtraction, and the whole reſulteth out of the aggregation of the parts, not by local contiguity alwaies, but by political, Eccleſiaſtical, habitual conſociation and union in the ſame external profeſſion, ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fraternity.</p>
                  <p>Again, that <hi>totum</hi> which is mutable and fluxile, is an integral, for a <hi>Genus</hi> is immutable, conſtant, permanent, <hi>aeternae veritatis,</hi> But the Church Oecumenical is very mutable and fluxile, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time flouriſhing, ſometime under perſecution: ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, ſometimes it may be laten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: ſometimes more pure, ſometimes more corrupt: ſometimes it hath more beauty and ſtrength, and ſometimes leſſe: and though this be in the parts and members, the particular Churches, yet it may be in the whole, and the beauty and ſtrength of the parts of a natural or civil body is the beauty and ſtrength of the whole man, City, Kingdom: every member hath his own beauty and ſtrength, and out of them all reſulteth the beauty and ſtrength of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Again, That <hi>totum</hi> which is meaſured by time and place, is an integral: for <hi>Genus</hi> which is a notion is capable of neither of them; but ſo is the Church Oecumenical: Hence we divide the Church into primitive and ſucceſſive. From the time of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers violence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.12. Sometime the Church hath been planted in the Eaſtern parts of the world, and now is more Weſterly, and is in likelihood ſtill going more Weſtward. We uſe to limit the Church within the pale thereof, though potentially, in regard of permiſſion, and (haply) promiſe, it may be actually over the whole earth. <hi>Amplitudo &amp; vetuſtas ſunt accidentia Eccleſiae viſibilis.</hi> See <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron de conspic.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57278:57"/>
is an integral: But there is admiſſion into the Church-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like viſible by Baptiſm, nutrition and edification by the other external Ordinances, and ejection out of it by excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Therefore it is an Integral. For a <hi>Genus</hi> is capable of none of theſe. Indeed if you conſider this ſociety in reference to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſocieties or religions, it is a diſtinct kinde, in regard of the Authour, laws, qualifications of members; but in reference unto its members it is an integral: If this be all that is meant by <hi>totum genericum existens,</hi> it may paſſe without any dammage to this queſtion. So the ſeveral companies in <hi>London</hi> are diſtinct from other companies, yet in reference to their own members they are integrals, and in reference to the whole they are parts.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That ſociety which hath not only a head or governour in heaven, of the ſame nature as man: but Officers on earth, which are indefinitely and habitually Officers to the whole, that is an integral: but ſo hath the Oecumenical Church, therefore it is an integral. A <hi>Genus</hi> is not capable of Officers: But the Church-Catholike had once (by M. <hi>Ellis</hi>'s own confeſſion) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, univerſal Officers, and was then one governed body: and ſtill the Officers are indefinitely and habitually Officers to the whole, as ſhall be proved in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.

                  <p n="7">7. That which hath actions and operations of its own, that is an integral, for a <hi>Genus</hi> is not capable thereof, but the Church-Catholike or Oecumenical hath or may have actions, operations and effects of its own. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The minor, upon which all the weight of this argument lyeth, is proved thus. The Church-Catholike viſible may by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates meet in a general Councel, about the affairs that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the whole, and though their power therein were but only conſultative and ſuaſive (as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> grants) yet it is an act of the whole, as the acts of a Kingdom repreſented in Parliament are ſaid to be national acts; but I conceive they may do more, even make decrees, as well as the Synod, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. They may confute and ſuppreſſe general hereſies and diſorders. Yea, and the whole Church-Catholike may yield conſent, ſubmiſſion and obedience thereunto, as their acts, finding them agreeable
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57278:57"/>
to the word of God.<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> There may be a general humiliation of the whole Church-Catholike viſible, or a general thankſgiving, as occaſion may be offered. There may be a general conteſtation with the ſame hereticks, and renouncing of their errours, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſuffering under, and conflict with, and conqueſt over the ſame adverſaries, as ſuppoſe Antichriſt, and Triumphing over them. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. <hi>the</hi> 7. <hi>firſt verſes,</hi> All Gods ſervants both ſmall and great are called to it. <hi>I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thundrings, ſaying, Allelujah.</hi> This was not the act of a particular Congregation, but of the Church Catholike, and yet all theſe are <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. bound up in an unity, and they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Lambs wife,</hi> and unto <hi>her</hi> was granted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Church-Catholike viſible alſo conquereth and ſubdueth ſpiritually the reſt of the world, and bringeth them into external ſubjection to Chriſt, and leaveneth them with the doctrine of Chriſt, and uniteth them to themſelves in this ſpiritual ſociety, ſo that they become <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> one body. And though this be done by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members and Churches, yet that hinders it not from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the act of the whole, as when an army of ſouldiers of one Kingdom conquer neighbour Kingdoms, and adde them to their own (as the <hi>Romans</hi> did all the world) it is accounted the action of the whole nation, or a national act: ſo is this caſe though the conqueſt differ in kinde. And this may ſerve for an anſwer to M. <hi>Hookers</hi> query, <hi>Surv.</hi> c. 16. p. 256. 259. <q>Whether the Church-Catholike can be conſidered as diſtinct from the particular Churches (not by ſeparation of the whole from the parts, but) in apprehenſion, by preſenting ſome diſtinct Officer, act, or operation, which do not pertain to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches.</q> For as there is a head and King of the whole, as viſible, and one ſyſteme of laws, and habitual, indefinite Officers of the whole, ſo you ſee there are acts and operations of the whole, both by their delegates, and by themſelves, which though they be performed by particular perſons belonging (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply) to particular Churches (as the ſouldiers making up an army belong to ſeveral Towns) yet do not perform them as particular members of the particular Churches, but of the whole, neither do they convert into the particular Churches,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57278:58"/>
but into the whole: as ſuch ſouldiers fight not as members of ſuch a Town, but of ſuch a Kingdom, and conquer not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their ſeveral Towns, but the Kingdom in general. And for conſtant actual Officers, and diſtinct ſervices, ſuch as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church of the Jews had, becauſe they could meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three times every year, and oftner upon occaſion, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected in the Oecumenical body, it being too large for ſuch conſtant meetings.</p>
                  <p>If the Church-Catholike can bring forth ſons, then it can perform operations: But it can bring forth ſons. This M. <hi>Ellis</hi> himſelf confeſſeth by conſequence, for in the cloſe of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Dedicatory before his <hi>vindiciae Catholicae,</hi> he ſubſcribes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>a ſonne of the Church.</hi> What other Church can he mean but the Catholike? If he meaneth the particular Church whereof he is Paſtour, he is not a ſon but a father, and governour of that: and then he ſhould more properly have ſaid, <hi>Sonne of a Church,</hi> not <hi>Sonne of the Church,</hi> for there be more Churches then this, unleſſe he meant <hi>the</hi> by way of eminency. He cannot mean of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for he denies all National Churches, therefore it muſt be of the Church-Catholike, and yet he denies that there is any ſuch thing viſible, and that which he doth acknowledge he makes a <hi>Genus;</hi> which is a ſecond no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without exiſtence, and then, as himſelf confeſſeth, <hi>Non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtentis nulla ſunt operationes.</hi> The <hi>ſpecies</hi> or <hi>Individuals</hi> cannot be ſonnes of the <hi>Genus.</hi> And therefore he ſhould more ſafely have ſubſcribed himſelf a member or Miniſter of the Church; and yet that muſt have proved the Church-Catholike: or of a Church, and then he might have meant his own.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It will appear by the ſeveral <hi>appellations</hi> which are given to the Church-Catholike in Scripture. For in Scripture it is called a <hi>Body,</hi> yea, <gap reason="foreign">

And ſuch as are only viſible members are called <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 8.12. And this Kingdom hath a King and Laws and Officers in it; now a Kingdom or ſociety is no <hi>Genus,</hi> but an Integral. It is alſo called a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> Revel. 21.3. which was a thing coupled together with tenons, ſoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, loops, and taches, and ſo an integral, no <hi>Genus,</hi> nor could ſignifie any.

If the inviſible Church be one body of Chriſt (as in the primary ſenſe they are) then by the ſame reaſon the viſible alſo (as viſible) are one body, for the only difference between them (as to this purpoſe) is in regard of the manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; the one inviſibly and inwardly, the other viſibly in outward Ordinances. The inviſible are called Chriſts body in alluſion to a natural body more properly; the viſible in alluſion to a political body. The inviſible Church are only in reference to Chriſt their head and fellow-inviſible members, but have no Officers under Chriſt (<hi>quà</hi> inviſible:) the viſible are one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Chriſt their profeſſed King, and his written laws, and fellow-viſible members, and indefinite Officers under Chriſt. The inviſible body might with better reaſon be called a <hi>Genus,</hi> becauſe their unity is only in the head, and in one kinde of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in ſpiritual relation to inviſible brethren; and therefore if they be called one body: then much more the viſible Church, whole union is in King, laws, the ſame qualifications, and external relation to viſible brethren, under indefinite Officers.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Hooker</hi> takes much pains in <hi>Surv.</hi> c. 15. to prove that the Church-Catholike viſible cannot be an Integral. To which I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57278:60"/>
ſhall anſwer under the ſeveral heads as they come in the Theſis.</p>
                  <p>His main Argument is becauſe that an <hi>Integrum</hi> reſulting out of the members, is <hi>Symbolum effecti,</hi> and ſo is in conſideration after the members whereof it is conſtituted, and out of which it doth reſult, and ſo that croſſeth the ſecond part or predicate of the Queſtion. This I ſhall refer to the ſecond part of the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That it will then require one viſible head over it. This I ſhall refer to that Objection in Chap. 5. Sect. 6.</p>

                  <p>An Objection may be raiſed here, That the Church-Catholike may by perſecutions, wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be brought into a narrow room, and haply to one Congregation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is poſſible, yet all the eſſence and priviledges of the Church-Catholike viſible are <hi>contracted and reſerved therein,</hi> and from them conveyed and derived miniſterially to thoſe whom they ſhall convert, and ſo ſhall dilate it ſelf again.</p>
                  <p>To this M. <hi>Ellis</hi> replyeth firſt, with little better then a ſcoff. <q>We ſee (ſaith he) what ſtraights this large conceit of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal viſible Church doth drive unto.</q> 
                     <hi>Vind.</hi> pag. 58. But I let that paſſe. He anſwers ſecondly, that this anſwer implyeth that the Church-Catholike is a <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and the particular Churches the ſeverals of it: this confoundeth univerſal and particular.</p>
                  <p>But how doth this imply it? Suppoſe a city ſhould by peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be brought to the tenth of the buildings and men that ſometime it had; yet retaining the ſame Charter and Officers, and priviledges, it is ſtill the ſame city, though not ſo great as before: and muſt this imply that the city as a <hi>genus</hi> or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and the particular ſtreets the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or particulars under it? no, but the city was the integral, and they the parts: it is now mutilated and maimed, but it may be reedifyed, and grow po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulous again: and ſo may the Church though much waſted. Nay it implyeth that it is not a <hi>genus,</hi> for that cannot be contracted nor dilated, for it is a notion not exiſting, as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth. <hi>Vind.</hi> pag. 58.</p>

                  <p>But he further objects, That this contracted Church extends not it ſelf to all perſons and places, as was ſaid of the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Actually the Church-Catholike did never ſo extend it ſelf when at largeſt, but <hi>potentially</hi> in regard there is liberty for all to accept it and enjoy thoſe priviledges, and ſo there is ſtill left.</p>
                  <p>O but this Congregation may fail, the Catholike cannot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The whole may in it ſelf, but is kept by Gods power and promiſe, at leaſt ſome remnants of it. For it cannot wholly fail.</p>
                  <p>O but an <hi>Integrum</hi> cannot be reſerved in a member of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It cannot be ſo large an <hi>Integrum,</hi> nor every way the ſame, yet the whole being ſimilar, though great part be taken away, yet the remainer is an integral to the parts that are left, though but a member to what was formerly.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here alſo conſider a little that notion whereby he would ſeem to untie the knot of this difficulty, p. 259. and 260.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That only (ſaith he) which put fair colours upon this falſe conceit, is the miſapprehenſion of ſome particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, <hi>viz.</hi> when they ſay, that any portion of water divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, every part of it is water, and hath the name and nature of it. The anſwer is, that the predication or affirmation of it is not by vertue of that diviſion of a portion of water that is made, as <hi>Integri in membra:</hi> but becauſe the nature is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the leaſt portion of it, and thence this predication, this water is water, is made good, becauſe a <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> are there preſerved and attended, going along with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of <hi>Integri in membra.</hi> For when we ſay <hi>Haec aqua eſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua,</hi> the Arguments are <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it is an eſſential predication it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but this doth not neceſſarily make them <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> for there is an eſſential predication of <hi>ſpecies infima</hi> on all the Individuals, as well as of the <hi>genus</hi> on the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but there is a great difference between the <hi>species</hi> and <hi>Individuals;</hi> for the <hi>ſpecies</hi> exiſt not, and therefore cannot be brought into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral, but the individuals may: as we ſee many great integrals
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57278:61"/>
of water in the ſea and rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which contain many indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals in one integral, but not many <hi>ſpecies:</hi> as may be ſhewed both in natural and political bodies.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the predication is not by vertue of that diviſion of <hi>Integri in membra,</hi> but becauſe the form of water, to which the properties of water do belong, is retained in the particular parts or members. And ſo every viſible beleever is called a Chriſtian, and a member of Chriſts viſible Kingdom, becauſe the form (<hi>viz.</hi> viſible beleeving) common to all Chriſtians and all members, is found in him: and every particular Church is called a Church, becauſe the form common to all Churches is found in it: to which forms all the priviledges and properties and promiſes of a Chriſtian or of a Church, as members of the whole body, do belong.</p>
                  <p>Now hence ariſeth another Queſtion more likely to decide the controverſie, <hi>viz.</hi> whence this right in this common nature doth ariſe? whether from its ſelf or by vertue of a Covenant? If by vertue of a Covenant, then whether by a Covenant between man and man, or between God and man? If by vertue of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between man and man, ſuch as is the Covenant of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations (which our brethren make the form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) which the particular members enter into: then none that want particular memberſhip, or are not inveſted thereinto by that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Covenant, can have any right to any priviledges or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Church. Then the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either wanted right to the Ordinances, priviledges and promiſes, or had their right by vertue of ſome particular member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of, and covenant with the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or ſome other particular Churches; but we reade of no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>Then how can a man converted from heatheniſm have right to Baptiſm, which is a priviledge of the Church, and an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, ſeeing he is no member of, nor in Covenant with any Congregation, neither can be until baptized, as I conceive, See <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. <hi>S.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>If this right come by the general viſible covenant between God and all viſible beleevers, and all theſe viſible beleevers by this general viſible Covenant are made an external body and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57278:61"/>
kingdom of Chriſt, then all theſe priviledges, and promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to viſible beleevers are given firſt to the whole body, and ſecondarily to the members thereof. The being a member for a particular Congregation giveth only opportunity of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the priviledges of the external body, but not the actual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate right thereunto, for that they had before any ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance or combination by vertue of their being viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,, and ſo being members of the body, in the general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Covenant. No man will ſay, that this particular drop of water is cold and moiſt, becauſe it is a part or member of this particular pond or river, but becauſe it is a part of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water, unto which primarily thoſe properties do belong, and yet the element of water is not united into one body, by any Covenant, as the whole Church is.</p>
                  <p>But if this be true that <hi>haec aqua est aqua,</hi> be <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> then it followeth that there are ſo many <hi>species</hi> of water as there be drops in the whole element of water, and ſo by conſequence a hundred thouſand <hi>ſpecies</hi> of water in every pail-full: and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>species</hi> of wine as there are drops of wine, and ſo many <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of milk as there are drops of milk, for it may be ſaid of every drop of water, wine, or milk, they are water, wine, or milk.</p>
                  <p>Can the variation only of ſituation, or accidents vary the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?</hi> This man is a man, there is <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies.</hi> 2. This man is an Engliſh man, there ſhould be another ſubalternal <hi>ſpecies.</hi> 3. This Engliſh is a <hi>Suffolk</hi> man, there ſhould be another inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>ſpecies.</hi> 4. This <hi>Suffolk</hi> man is of ſuch a particular hundred, there ſhould be another inferiour <hi>ſpecies.</hi> 5. This man is of ſuch a Town in that hundred, as ſuppoſe <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> there is another inferiour <hi>ſpecies.</hi> 6. This <hi>Ipſwich</hi> man is of ſuch a Pariſh, there is another <hi>ſpecies.</hi> 7. This man of ſuch a Pariſh is of ſuch a ſtreet in the Pariſh, there is another inferiour <hi>ſpecies.</hi> 8. This man is of ſuch a Family in ſuch a ſtreet, there in another inferiour <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> The like deſcention may be made of particular Churches. By this reaſon man will prove a very large <hi>Genus,</hi> that hath ſo many ſubalternal <hi>ſpecies</hi> under him, and many more may be made by the ſame reaſon. Yea, the ſame man will vary his <hi>ſpecies</hi> as oft as he varieth his place. I conceive this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57278:62"/>
                     <hi>Haec aqua eſt aqua,</hi> will at beſt be but <hi>ſpecies infima &amp; indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum:</hi> and the like of <hi>hic homo eſt homo:</hi> but the predication of this man by the ſeveral particular diviſions and ſubdiviſions of the Kingdom will prove <hi>denominatio adjunctae perſonae à ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectis:</hi> and this diviſion of a Kingdom into more particular parts, will rather prove a diviſion of <hi>integri in membra</hi> then <hi>generis in ſpecies,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe this ſhould be granted (which Logicians will not) yet it muſt alſo be granted, that as there may be ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond notions of <hi>this man,</hi> or <hi>this Church,</hi> raiſed by <hi>logical ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,</hi> ſo there muſt needs be an integrality reſulting out of <hi>phyſical</hi> contiguity, or <hi>political</hi> conjunction and aggregation of places, perſons and Churches.</p>
                  <p>But let it be ſuppoſed that by logical abſtraction we may draw a notion of a <hi>genus</hi> from the ſimilarity of all Churches, or community of nature in all Churches, though the Churches dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not from each other by any eſſential, different, ſpecifical forms, but only accidentally, as individuals: yet alſo it muſt be granted that by the unity of the Covenant and Charter wherein they are all bound up in an unity, and by political combination which neceſſarily followeth thereupon, we may raiſe an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grality, for they are all members of the Church-militant, of Chriſts external Kingdom on earth, and ſo they become really and neceſſarily members of a <hi>political integrum.</hi> And on this Integral were the priviledges of the Church beſtowed primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and on particular viſible Churches but ſecondarily, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the whole body. Let it be granted that theſe priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are beſtowed by God upon ſuch a ſort of men, ſo and ſo qualified (<hi>viz.</hi> viſible beleevers) and from their ſimilarity of diſpoſition, may be drawn a community of nature or diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the priviledges of the Church do not accrue unto them, becauſe ſo and ſo qualified, but by vertue of that one external, individual Covenant of God, made unto ſuch qualified perſons, by which external Covenant they are made externally one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual, external, viſible body.</p>
                  <p>And if the ſame company of men ſo qualified can make a <hi>Genus</hi> by abſtraction (though there be no ſpecifical diſtinct ſubalternal forms) and yet be an Integral becauſe of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57278:62"/>
viſible Covenant under one head, into which they are all entred, which is the fountain of all their priviledges, I ſhall yield the Church Catholike viſible to be a <hi>Genus,</hi> as well as an <hi>Integrum:</hi> and call it with <hi>Ames, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliter Integrale.</hi> But if ſuch an uſe can be made of that logical tenet, that <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are ſpecies,</hi> (which yet moſt Logicians do deny) that thoſe individuals cannot be political members of one greater body, I fear it will prove more prejudicial to policy, then beneficial to Logick.</p>
                  <p>Again, that which M. <hi>Hooker</hi> makes peculiar to an Integral, from that which we call <hi>totum univerſale</hi> is, that <hi>what belongs to this, doth not belong to all its members,</hi> Sur. c. 15. p. 256.

                  <p>I ſhall note alſo two things in that Chapter wherein M.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> miſtaketh my meaning. Firſt, in the ſeventh propoſition which he collects out of my Theſis ſet down, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 52, <hi>Every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church partaketh of part of the matter, and part of the form of the whole.</hi> Which p. 261. he makes uſe of again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and renders it thus, <hi>Eccleſia Catholica gives part of the matter and part of the form to all particular Churches.</hi> But my meaning was, it doth conſiſt of part of the matter, and part of the form of the whole: as a room in an houſe conſiſteth of, and ſo (in that ſenſe) may be ſaid to partake of part of the matter, and part of the form of the whole, not as a <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but as a member of the houſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond miſtake of my meaning is, that he conceiveth I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Jewiſh Church the Catholike Church, becauſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the Church-Catholike to be <hi>the Whole company of beleevers in the whole world.</hi> p. 263. And thereupon undertakes to prove that the Church was <hi>in populo Iſraelitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> and not <hi>in populo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholìco.</hi> But this never came into my thoughts; but I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Jews to be a national Church. But my deſcription of the Church-Catholike was of the Church as it is now, ſince the partition wall is broken down, for then it became Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. I conceive there were beleevers of the ſonnes of <hi>Keturah,</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:57278:63"/>
that did not partake of all the priviledges of the Jewiſh Church, except they became proſelytes. It is the Evangel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cal Catholike Church which my Queſtion is about; into which the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being converted, were admitted by a new initial ſeal, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, and did not ſtand in it by their former national mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, but received a Catholike memberſhip by baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>And hereupon he undertakes to make out my method of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the right of Church-priviledges to croſſe Gods me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. He ſets down my method thus. Firſt, when a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and ſo becomes a viſible beleever, he is then a member of the Church-Catholike. 2. He hath by this profeſſion and memberſhip with the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike right unto all Church-priviledges, 3. He then becomes a member of a particular Church, but hath no right to Church-priviledges becauſe of that, but becauſe of his former member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Church-Catholike.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall own this method rightly underſtood, though they were not my words, but only collected out of them. I conceive that a man of any Nation converted to be a viſible beleever, is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church-Catholike entitive, being within the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral external Covenant: and hereby hath right to all Church-priviledges, that belong to the whole Church, and that his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular memberſhip which he comes to next, doth not afford him his right but opportunity only.</p>
                  <p>But when M. <hi>Hooker</hi> comes to ſhew how this croſſeth Gods method, he only ſheweth that it croſſeth the method that God uſed in the national Church of the Jews, which being <hi>in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Iſraelitico</hi> muſt needs differ from the method <hi>in populo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholico.</hi> A perſon being a viſible beleever muſt join himſelf to the Jewiſh Church before he can partake of their priviledges, becauſe the priviledges by Gods Covenant were ſo given, but now the Covenant is Catholike, it is ſufficient to be in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Covenant to make a man have right to the priviledges of the Covenant; opporunity indeed cometh by joyning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome particular Congregations, where the Ordinances are adminiſtred, or ſome particular priviledges, but not the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>For my part therefore I conceive and conclude, that the

Church: but I expreſſed the condition of being baptized, and ſo in the general Covenant, and then he ought to aſſociate with the Church where God layeth out his habitation, and they ought not to refuſe him, except there be ſufficient cauſe of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For of any Chriſtians dwelling in any city or Town, where there was a Church, and he not to be a member of that Church, or to be a member of another Church in another Town or City, and reſide in his own but <hi>per accidens</hi> (as ſome diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh) hath neither example nor warrant in the Scripture. And muſt imply either that he holdeth them not to be a Church and ſo not of the Kingdom of Chriſt, or elſe ſuch a corrupt part that he dares not joyn himſelf with them. And as a man that comes to dwell in a Town ought not to refuſe to be a member of that town, but ſhall be ruled by the Officers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in civil affairs, and if he like not, he may, yea muſt remove from them, if he will not ſubmit himſelf; and if he continue with them, he will be liable to puniſhment or reſtraint, by thoſe civil Officers, if there be juſt cauſe: ſo I conceive If any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſubject of Chriſts Kingdom ſhall ſit down, and cohabit with a Church within the civil limits allotted for ſuch a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, he not only ought to aſſociate with them, but the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of that Church ought to take the inſpection of him, and if he be dangerouſly hererical or prophane, and thereby dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and offenſive, they ought to take care of his cure, and the preſervation of the reſt of their members, by cenſuring of him, whether he will or no, in regard of his habitual general mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, and their habitual indefinite office. And though civil prudential limits, wherein a Congregation dwels, give no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality to the Church being heterogeneal, yet as the limits of the particular ſeas, and their names, are from the ſhoars and lands they are bounded by, though heterogeneal; ſo may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches well be bounded and denominated by their civil limits.

                  <p>I now proceed to prove the Church-Catholike to be <hi>viſible,</hi>

                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> which is the thing ſo much denied by many Divines. There is indeed an inviſible Church of Chriſt, and that Catholike, but if you take Catholike for Orthodoxal, and alſo for univerſal, and that in the largeſt ſenſe of all, comprehending all places and all times, both paſt, preſent, and to come, ſome militant, ſome triumphant, for whoſe ſakes principally Chriſt died, and the Ordinances were given, and the viſible Church was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. Which inviſible company are only known to God, and are given by the Father to Chriſt to redeem and ſave. And theſe perſons though they be viſible in their generations, and enjoy viſible communion in the viſible Church, whereof they are ordinarily viſible members, yet beſides that they have invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible grace, and inviſible communion with Chriſt their head, by faith on their parts and the Spirit on his part, and only theſe ſhall be ſaved: yet that is not the Church that is meant in this queſtion, but the external Church of Chriſt conſiſting of true beleevers and hypocrites; in which ſenſe the Scripture oft takes the word Church, I ſay, the external, political body and kingdom of Chriſt, as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> cals it.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Church which <hi>Valle Meſſalinus,</hi> or <hi>Salmaſius, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius, Spanhemius,</hi> and <hi>Cameron de regimine Eccleſiae,</hi> and <hi>Polanus de Eccleſia viſibili univerſili,</hi> and M. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> M. <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> and M. <hi>Parker,</hi> and divers others, mean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m, quaeſtio eſt quomodo ſit viſibilis, quatenus, quando, &amp; quibus.</hi> Cam. <hi>de conſpic, Ec.</hi> p. 248.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57278:65"/>
And he addeth that this viſibility rather ſheweth, <hi>Quid ſit Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, quàm quae ſit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now viſible is that which may be ſeen, <hi>Viſibile eſt quod videri poteſt,</hi> i. e. that which hath a capableneſſe in it ſelf to be ſeen: herein it differs from <hi>viſum,</hi> for that is that which is actually ſeen. Now as <hi>Cameron</hi> and others of this ſubject do diſtinguiſh, things may be ſaid to be viſible either <hi>per ſe &amp; primariò,</hi> and ſo only light and colour are viſible, or elſe <hi>per accidens,</hi> and ſo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, magnitude, motion, and all other things, which we ſay are viſible are ſeen: a man is not ſeen <hi>per ſe,</hi> but <hi>per accidens.</hi> The ſecond kinde of viſibility is meant in this queſtion, <hi>viz. per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens &amp; per effecta,</hi> as all other ſocieties are viſible.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a thing may be ſaid to he viſible, either <hi>distinctè</hi> or <hi>confutè.</hi> The Church-Catholike is viſible in the ſecond ſenſe, which <hi>Cameron</hi> alſo granteth, p. 246. And <hi>aliquatenus, aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, &amp; aliquo modo, &amp; aliquibus.</hi> p. 247.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a thing may be ſaid to be viſible either <hi>uno intuitu, &amp; ſimul;</hi> or <hi>ſecundum partes,</hi> at ſeveral aſpects. The firſt way only one ſide of a thing can be ſeen, <hi>viz.</hi> one plain, and ſmall ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The ſame man cannot be ſeen at the ſame view in all his external parts, nor yet the Sun which is moſt viſible. The Church-Catholike cannot be ſeen <hi>uno intuitu,</hi> but <hi>ſecundum par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſive membra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſome things are viſible only by the eye, and judged of by the common ſenſe; but ſome other things require an act of the underſtanding to put thoſe viſible parts together, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the unity thereof. The unity of a man or a tree the very beaſt can diſcern, but the unity of a ſociety or Kingdom, though it be viſible, they cannot diſcern, becauſe they want underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put the parts together.</p>
                  <p>And in this laſt ſenſe the Church-Catholike is ſaid to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as a Kingdom or Empire is: the eye and common ſenſe alone cannot diſcern the unity of it, but there is requiſite an act of the underſtanding to put the viſible parts together in apprehenſion. No man will deny an Empire to be viſible, becauſe he cannot ſee the union of it with his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Again, I did not take viſible in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, <hi>viſibile eſt quod radiat per medium, ut luminoſum, &amp; coloratum,</hi> but for that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57278:65"/>
which is perceptible by any of the ſenſes, yea, to the perceiving of which there is required an act of the underſtanding alſo, to conceive of it, and put the parts together, yet not by logical abſtraction, but mental appoſition and conjunction, as we muſt do to perceive the unity of a Kingdom. The nearer the parts lie, the more is the viſibility; and the further off, the leſſe. A Congregation is more viſible (in this ſenſe) then a National Church, and a National then the Oecumenical. The more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the <hi>copula</hi> or bond is, the more viſible the thing is.</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewed you what Church-Catholike is viſible, and how the Church-Catholike may be ſaid to be viſible; I come to prove by arguments that it is viſible or perceptible. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the difficulty lyeth not here, but in the integrality, for if the Church-Catholike be an integral, it will eaſily appear to be a viſible one.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the ſubject matter,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> the perſons of whom the Church-Catholike doth conſiſt, be viſible, the whole Church is viſible alſo: But they are all viſible: Therefore ſo is the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>That the whole Church conſiſteth of men and women who are viſible beleevers (not viſible as men, but as beleevers alſo) none will deny. That the viſibility of the whole will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, is as undeniably true, for what makes a thing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but the viſibility of the materials? The eſſential forms of the moſt viſible things are not viſible, as of a ſtone, or a man. Nothing can be ſaid to be inviſible, whoſe materials are viſible.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the converſion into the whole Church be viſible, then the whole Church is viſible. But the converſion is viſible. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That converſion into the viſible Church is viſible, none can deny. The Apoſtles made a viſible conqueſt of the world by their preaching. They were charged by <hi>Demetrius</hi> to have <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world upſide down,</hi> Act. 17.6. They turn'd men <hi>from Idols, to ſerve the living and true God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.9. That this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not into a particular Congregation, but into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal viſible body and kingdom of Chriſt, is as clear; and the gathering them into particular Congregations, and ſetting El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57278:66"/>
over them was a ſecond work.<note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> And the conſequence will follow, for ſuch as the converſion is, ſuch is the Church into which they are converted; viſible converſion makes no man a member of the inviſible body, but of the viſible only, inviſible grace is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for that.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the profeſſion, ſubjection, obedience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the members of the whole Church be viſible, then the whole Church is viſible. But they are viſible. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The aſſumption none will deny. It is called a <hi>profeſſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Your obedience is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad unto all. Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works,</hi> Mat. 5.16. It is toward God in duties of the firſt table, and towards men in duties of the ſecond, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, chaſtity, equity, truth, humility, meekneſſe. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. yea, viſible to them that are without, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. Now what reference hath this profeſſion, ſubjection, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, converſation to the particular Congregations? Do they profeſſe, ſubject themſelves to the laws of Chriſt, and yield obedience thereunto in a godly converſation, becauſe they are members of this or that particular Congregation, or becauſe they are entred into the general Covenant, whereby they are made ſubjects and members of Chriſts Kingdom? Is the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confederation the ground and cauſe of their profeſſion, ſubjection, obedience, and godly converſation? Were not theſe found in them before they were thought meet to be entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particular confederation? were they not judged to be ſubjects to Chriſt, and viſible members of his body, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Covenant, before their admittance? How then could that be the ground thereof? Indeed there are ſome particular duties and priviledges which relate in an eſpecial manner to the particular Congregation, and a particular unity of a particular Church, as a member of the whole body reſulteth therefrom, but not the general duties, priviledges, or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a man be a freeman of ſome Corporation, as <hi>Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwich,</hi> though thereby he hath the priviledges of the particular Corporation belonging to him, and particular duties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57278:66"/>
to the Corporation are required of him, and he requires and receiveth the priviledge of a ſubject the execution of the laws of the Kingdom there; yet he muſt be conceived a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Kingdom, before he can be admitted a free man of the Corporation, and he receives the general priviledges, and performs the general duties, in reference to that, and not in reference to the particular Corporation, and his memberſhip thereof; though he hath the opportunity of enjoying the one, and performance of the other, in that particular ſociety. And yet this doth not make the kingdom a <hi>Genus,</hi> and the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration a <hi>species</hi> thereof, but the kingdom an integral, and the Corporation a member thereof. So is the caſe between the whole Church and the particular. Yet with this difference, all the particular Churches are ſimilar patts of the whole Church, ſo are not all Corporations, nor all villages, they differ ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in kindes of Officers, ſometimes in particular immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the ſimilarity of the parts of the whole Church, gives the ſame denomination to the particular Churches with the whole, the particular Congregation is called a Church as well as the whole, whereas no particular Corporation is called a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and this is the cauſe why the particular Churches are deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>ſpecies,</hi> whereas indeed they are members of the whole, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of the identity of denomination, but identity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination or ſimilarity of parts, are not ſufficient to make a <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> eſpecially where the whole is conſtituted by an external Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Officers which Chriſt hath given to the whole Church, be viſible, then ſo is the Church. But the Officers are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Officers are viſible none will deny, becauſe they are viſibly called, ordained, and execute their office viſibly. That viſible Officers argue a viſible polity, is as clear, ſuch as the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are (in reſpect of viſibility or inviſibility) ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. That the miniſtry is given to the whole Church, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites were to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that they are all Officers of the whole habitual, and habitually have power to diſpenſe the Ordinances of Chriſt in any part of the whole Church upon a call, ſhall be proved. c. 6. ſ. 4.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:57278:67"/>5. If the admittance into the whole Church, and ejection out of it be viſible, then the whole Church is viſible. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance by Baptiſm, ejection by excommunication are viſible. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That admittance and ejection being publike acts before the whole Congregation, are viſible, none will deny. That ſuch as the admittance or ejection is (in regard of viſibility) ſuch is the ſociety or polity, is as clear. That the admittance is into the whole, and ejection out of it, hath been proved already, and ſhall more fully afterward. Either by Baptiſm men are admitted into the particular Church, or the whole Church, or no Church: but not into the particular Congregation, no man is baptized into the particular Congregation, it is not the ſeal of the particular Covenant: therefore it is into the whole or none. If a heathen be converted in a Congregation, firſt he receives baptiſm, afterward is admitted a member of the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation.</p>
                  <p n="6">

                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note>6. If the Doctrine, Laws, Ordinances, Charter, and Covenant of the whole Church, be viſible, then ſo is the whole Church. But they are viſible. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Doctrine, Laws, Ordinances, Charter, and Covenant of the whole Church are viſible, none will deny, for they may be ſeen, read, preached, and heard. That they belong to, and conſtitute the whole, is as undeniable. Of the ſame nature that the laws, and charter of a kingdom is (in reſpect of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility) of the ſame nature is the kingdom. Now it is not the inviſible law of nature written in the heart, that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the viſible Church, for the heathens have that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. nor is it the inviſible law of grace, promiſed to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Gods peoples hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. for many members of the viſible Church have not that; but it is the viſible ſyſteme of laws, and Covenant given by Chriſt to his viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>And theſe Laws, Charter, and Covenant are the very <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula</hi> or bond of the external body and kingdom of Chriſt, and thereby they are bound to worſhip and diſcipline. Now <hi>where the copula or bond uniting viſible parts together, is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there the whole is viſible, But the copula or bond is viſible,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57278:67"/>
Therefore ſo is the whole.</hi> A viſible bond cannot unite inviſible members.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this it is objected by M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> That divers ſeveral kingdoms may be governed by the ſame laws, and yet remain ſeveral kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, it is poſſible that all the kingdoms of the earth may ſubmit to, and be governed by the ſame ſyſteme of laws, and many now are by the civil law, and yet remain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral. But they ariſe not from the ſame fountain, the ſame King or Governours, nor binde not in ſubjection and obedience unto the ſame King, nor to mutual duties of ſubjects between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as fellow-ſubjects: but are embraced <hi>vi materiae</hi> or <hi>formae,</hi> becauſe found convenient, and receive a ſeveral ſtamp of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the ſeveral States or Governours, whereby they are obliging in the ſeveral kingdoms. But theſe laws proceed from the ſame fountain, the ſame Lord Jeſus, the king of the whole, and are obliging from the ſame authority to all Chriſtians in the whole world, therefore they are one viſible Church or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom myſtical. If the whole Church be a <hi>Genus,</hi> it is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and united together by a viſible external Covenant and Laws, which is not conſiſtent with the nature of a <hi>Genus</hi> as a <hi>Genus.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. If all the adminiſtrations and diſpenſations, and operations of the whole Church be viſible, ſo is the whole Church: But they are all viſible. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

A man dwelling in any part of the kingdom being tried at <hi>Suffolk</hi> Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes may receive his ſentence and execution there, if guilty. So all Church-adminiſtrations are by the ſame laws, and upon the ſame command; and perſons of any Church in the world may

hear, ſing, pray, and communicate any where indefinitely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion, though conſtantly the particular members only enjoy thoſe particular adminiſtrations from thoſe particular Officers.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer further, that the Church-Catholike may act viſibly by their delegates (as a Kingdom in a Parliament) in a general Councel, if they can convene: though their power were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſultatory and ſuaſory (as ſome pleade) but it is more. All their debates, arguings <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> all their advice and decrees are viſible: therefore the whole whoſe delegates they are, is viſible alſo. The inviſible Church (as inviſible) ſend none.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If it be our duty to joyn our ſelves viſibly to the Church-Catholike, then it is viſible: But we ought to joyn our ſelves to the Church-Catholike. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Aſſumption none will deny. As ſoon as the 3000. were converted by <hi>Peter,</hi> they were added to the Church. Chriſtians may not ſtand alone independently. Now that muſt be a viſible Church that we muſt joyn unto, for the inviſible is within the viſible, and cannot be known. God commands no impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It is true indeed we muſt joyn to ſome particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation (as a forreigner coming over into <hi>England</hi> to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, being naturalized, muſt dwell in ſome particular Town) but to that Congregation as a member of the whole, wherein we may enjoy the general priviledges of ſubjects of Chriſt firſt, and the particular priviledges of that Congregation ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. There is no particular command to joyn to this or that particular Congregation, but the whole; neceſſity compelleth to chooſe one. Our particular joyning to this or that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is not in obedience to the command, for then, had we joyned to another we had broken a command, therefore that is arbitrary and limited by civil habitation neceſſarily.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If the accidents of the whole Church be viſible, then ſo is the whole Church. But there be viſible accidents of the whole Church. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>An inviſible ſubject hath not viſible accidents. But ſo hath the whole Church, as beauty, ſtrength, order, amplitude, which may encreaſe or decreaſe, and theſe are accidents of the whole

ariſing and reſulting from all the parts conjoyned, and made up of the beauty, ſtrength, order, and amplitude of all the parts.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there may be general, viſible oppoſition againſt the whole Church, not becauſe in particular confederation, but the general. Theſe perſecutors are viſible, their actions are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly managed, by attachments, priſons, fire and faggot: their effects viſible: fines, impriſonments, confiſcation, baniſhment and death: and therefore the object hereof, the whole Church, muſt needs be viſible alſo. And all this meerly becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt, and have given up their names to him.

                     <q>There is <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> great difference between natural and metaphyſical, or civil and politick bodies.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> M. <hi>Ellis</hi> knows I took not the Church-Catholike for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57278:69"/>
a <hi>Genus,</hi> but an Integral. But let it be ſuppoſed a <hi>Genus</hi> for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſake, or as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> cals it, <hi>Totum genericum exiſtens,</hi> which is ſomething fairer then M. <hi>Ellis</hi>'s grant; for by M. <hi>Ellis</hi>'s reaſoning the Church-Catholike ſhould be a <hi>Genus</hi> drawn by the reaſon of man, and ſo exiſting only <hi>in intellectu noſtro.</hi> I ſay, ſuppoſe the Church-Catholike to be a <hi>Genus,</hi> and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches <hi>Species,</hi> yet this is not ſufficient to make the Church-Catholike to be inviſible, Will any man ſay, that <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal eſt ſubſtantia inviſibilis,</hi> becauſe it exiſteth only <hi>in homine &amp; bruto?</hi> Indeed animality in the abſtract is inviſible, but not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal in concreto:</hi> ſo <hi>Eccleſietas</hi> (as I may ſay) is inviſible, but <hi>Eccleſia</hi> is viſible. Viſibility is an accident belonging pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily to a higher <hi>Genus</hi> then <hi>animal,</hi> viz. <hi>Corpus celoratum,</hi> and though every Individual animal is viſible, as <hi>John</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> yet not <hi>quà John</hi> or <hi>James</hi> but as coloured bodies: and if a higher <hi>Genus</hi> be viſible, which is nearer <hi>Ens,</hi> and further from <hi>Individuals,</hi> then much more animal. So in this caſe the Church-Catholike is a ſociety of men, and that M. <hi>Ellis</hi> denyeth not; now every ſociety of men is viſible, and therefore the Church which is a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of ſociety muſt needs be ſo alſo, for the viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity doth not betide it, becauſe it is a particular Congregation, but becauſe it is a ſociety of men, which is a higher <hi>Genus:</hi> I mean this in a logical conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Then he proceeds to <hi>deny a civil body or Corporation, if great,</hi> 
                     <q>as an Empire, Kingdom, or large city, to be ſeen in it ſelf, but in the parts.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here he confounds <hi>viſibile</hi> and <hi>viſum uno intuitu:</hi> and by this reaſoning he ſhould deny the viſibility of the world, or any particular man, for all his parts cannot be ſeen <hi>uno intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itu. Attamen inſaniat qui neget ſe videre hominem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cameron.</hi> Yea, the ſun it ſelf ſhould not be viſible by this reaſoning, becauſe we can ſee but the ſurface of it.

                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas I had ſaid the whole is viſible, becauſe the parts are ſo. He ſaith it is untrue <hi>even in the ſmalleſt bodies, but where the parts are actually united together, not where they are thouſands of miles aſunder.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true indeed in natural and artificial bodies, whoſe being or integrality conſiſteth in a corporeal continuity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity of parts; for if that continuity or contiguity ceaſeth, the integral alſo ceaſeth, except in <hi>potentiâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in political bodies joyned together by laws, under one government, it is otherwiſe; the diſtance of place hinders not the integrality of the whole, and though it cannot be ſeen <hi>uno intuitu,</hi> by the ſame man at once (unleſſe by way of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, as in a Parliament or Common-Councel, as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> ſaith) nor yet be perceived to be one without ſome act of the underſtanding, yet this maketh not the City or Empire invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>He confeſſeth the Church-Catholike to be viſible in reſpect of the ſeveral parts, and places where they dwell: but this (ſaith he) is to prevaricate, and to prove that which is not in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. But he might remember that I took viſible in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the terms of the queſtion, to be meant in regard of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible communion in holy Ordinances, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hough the perſons never congregate into one place, to be ſeen with one mans eye; but in oppoſition to inward inviſible communion. Let him grant but ſuch a viſibility of the Church-Catholike as was in any of the four Monarchies, or a civil kingdom, which yet are ſeen but in their ſeveral parts and places, and I contend for no more. I ſuppoſe no particular Congregation was ever ſeen together, in all the members thereof, <hi>uno in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uitu:</hi> and yet is viſibly one in regard of the particular confederation, and uſual meeting of moſt of the members. Is not <hi>England</hi> a viſible Kingdom, though ſeen but in the parts of it? was it not viſible before there was a Parliament to repreſent it, or doth it ceaſe to be viſible in the intervals of Parliaments? The viſibility of it conſiſteth in the viſibility of the Perſons, Corporations, Places, Laws, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So is the caſe of the Church-Catholike whoſe Perſons, Places, Laws (which are the viſible bond) and government are as external and viſible as thoſe of the Kingdom, <hi>i. e.</hi> lyable to ſenſe, and perceivable by ſenſe, though not actually ſeen by the ſame man at once.</p>
                  <p>I deſire it might be noted that the Church-Catholike which our Divines ſpeak of in their diſputes againſt the Papiſts, is not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57278:70"/>
this Church-Catholike which we have now in hand, but that is the whole Church or company of the elect, both paſt, preſent, and to come. It is the Church taken in the firſt ſenſe, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the terms of the Queſtion, not the external, politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, mixed Church or kingdom of Chriſt. Neither doth that Church agree with this, but only nominally and equivocally, in that it is called by the ſame name, but it is not the ſame in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or ſenſe: and therefore ſhould that and this be uſed in a ſyllogiſm, there would be 4 terms. For that Church is neither external, nor viſible, nor exiſtent, nor organical, it hath no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, it is no polity: it is not that which M. <hi>Hooker</hi> cals <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum genericum exiſtens:</hi> for many of them are already in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> many not yet born, many not yet converted.</p>
                  <p>Now to make that the <hi>Genus</hi> of the viſible, external, political Churches of Chriſt, were as abſurd as to make the veſſels of gold to be the <hi>Genus</hi> of the ſilver, brazen, pewter, wooden, ſtony and earthen veſſels of a houſe, or a marble building to be the <hi>Genus</hi> of all the buildings of other ſtones, brick and timber. And therefore to diſpute from that to this, is not <hi>ad idem.</hi> I ſuppoſe that neither M. <hi>Hooker</hi> nor M. <hi>Ellis</hi> meant that Church, no more then I.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>genus</hi> comprehend only inviſible members, the <hi>species</hi> ſhould be only of inviſible members alſo. The <hi>genus</hi> is of the ſame nature or predicament with the <hi>species,</hi> and all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the <hi>species</hi> is found in the <hi>genus,</hi> and fetched from thence. There is nothing in man, but it is in <hi>animal,</hi> except the ſpecifical form, whereby he differs from a brute, and nothing in <hi>animal</hi> but it is in man, except its totality or generality, whereby it comprehends man and brute. If <hi>homo</hi> and <hi>brutum</hi> be viſible living ſubſtances, they received it from <hi>animal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>genus</hi> giveth eſſence to the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and is <hi>ſymbolum cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae materialis:</hi> but the Church of the Elect giveth not eſſence, nor matter to the viſible Church: for there are many members of this which are not inviſible: neither are the elect members of this, <hi>quà</hi> inviſible, but <hi>quà</hi> exiſtent and viſible. The viſible and inviſible Church are contra diſtinct branches of a diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ex adjunctis, vel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> communionis,</hi> therefore the one cannot
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57278:70"/>
be the <hi>genus</hi> of the other; for then <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies</hi> ſhould not be of the ſame general predication or denomination; but the inviſible ſhould be <hi>genus</hi> of the viſible; one branch be <hi>genus</hi> of the other, which is contrary to all Logick.</p>
                  <p>The inviſibility of this <hi>genus</hi> ariſeth not from a ſeparation of the inviſible members from the viſible, or the ſheep from the goats, but ariſeth from a mental abſtraction; it is the inviſibility of a notion, not of the perſons: It is not by culling out ſuch as have inviſible grace, and leaving the reſt; for that which is ſo cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, is not comprehenſive of them both. The <hi>Genus</hi> drawn by logical, mental abſtraction from the moſt corporeal, viſible ſubſtances, is as inviſible, <hi>quà genus,</hi> as a <hi>genus</hi> of incorporeal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible ſubſtances.</p>
                  <p>Either that Church-Catholike which our Divines ſpeak of, is the <hi>Genus</hi> of particular viſible Churches, or it is not. If it be, then it muſt be an external viſible polity (in general notion) which muſt comprehend all the external, viſible, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Polities on earth; and ſo hypocrites as well as the elect. The <hi>ſpecies</hi> conſiſt of ſuch matter, and therefore ſo muſt the <hi>genus,</hi> in the notion, I mean: but that they deny of their Church-Catholike viſible.</p>
                  <p>If it be not: then it is not the Church-Catholike which M. <hi>Hooker</hi> and M. <hi>Ellis</hi> intend; for they intend a general Church which comprehends in notion all the viſible Churches under it. And therefore they differ from our Divines in their meaning of the Church-Catholike, as much as I do; And ſo joyn not, nor concur with our Divines in the ſame ſubject, neither is it <hi>adidem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if we make the Church-Catholike an abſtract, general notion, comprehending all particular Churches under it as a <hi>genus,</hi> then we make Chriſts viſible, external Kingdom on earth, only a <hi>logical, non-exiſting notion;</hi> and the particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to be the ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, all comprehended under one logical, comprehenſive notion; and the particular Covenant or confederation of ſuch or ſuch a company between themſelves, ſhould conſtitute a kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo when a man removes from one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation into another, he ſhould remove out of one <hi>ſpecies</hi> into another: and in the <hi>interim</hi> be quite out of the kingdom of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57278:71"/>
Chriſt; becauſe he is out of all the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Chriſts kingdom, and a particular member cannot exiſt under this <hi>genus,</hi> for it is a <hi>genus</hi> of Congregations, <hi>quà</hi> Congregations, and not of ſingle perſons. And then it will follow, that many a viſible beleever ſhall be no member of Chriſts viſible external kingdom; or elſe that after he is a viſible exiſting ſubject of Chriſts kingdom, he may chooſe which <hi>species</hi> of Chriſts kingdom he will exiſt in; and that is as abſurd, as if there ſhould be an exiſting <hi>animal,</hi> that will chooſe whether he will be a man or a brute: who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that there is a viſible exiſtence of many a viſible belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who is a ſubject of Chriſts viſible kingdom, before he be admitted into any of thoſe Congregations, which are (by this opinion accounted) <hi>species.</hi> Now if we account the particular Churches members of Chriſts Kingdom, it is not abſurd for any ſubject of Chriſt, to chooſe which part of Chriſts kingdom, or which Eccleſiaſtical Corporation he will dwell in or adhere unto, for the actual enjoyment of the Priviledges, Laws, and Ordinances of Chriſts Kingdom: no more then for a ſubject of a King to chooſe in what part of the Kingdom he will dwell. The Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> though a political body, yet contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under, or in it, not only all Corporations and villages, but all ſingle perſons, that are ſubject to the King and Laws, though they be not fixed, and though they want by their unfixedneſſe the particular priviledges of the particular Towns they might have inhabited, and ſo the actual opportunity of enjoyment of the benefit of the Laws adminiſtred in ſuch Corporations or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet have an habitual right to the general priviledges, by being ſubjects: ſo have unfixed members of Chriſts external Kingdom, which reacheth ſingle viſible ſubjects as well as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined. Nay, a man may better make the kingdom of <hi>England</hi> a <hi>Genus,</hi> and all the Corporations and villages <hi>species</hi> thereof, becauſe they are many of them diſtinct and different in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, then the Church-Catholike a <hi>Genus,</hi> and the particular Congregations <hi>ſpecies,</hi> which are of one conſtitution. And if <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum genericum exiſtens,</hi> can have any ſenſe put upon it, it will agree to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> (or any other kingdom) for it conſiſteth of a ſort of men (<hi>viz.</hi> Engliſh-men) exiſting in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties and Towns: but as that notion hinders not the

                  <p>The ſame Objection lyeth as well againſt any aggregative body.

                  <p>I anſwer, It is true, in bodies made up by phyſical or artificial aggregation, there muſt indeed be ſome contiguity or nearneſſe of parts; but in political aggregation (and ſuch M. <hi>Ellis</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, <hi>vind.</hi> p. 5. l. 38.) it is not neceſſary. M. <hi>Ellis</hi> makes the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> one by aggregation; and yet hath not (I ſuppoſe) caſt thoſe ſeveral territories one upon another; as the Giants are feigned to throw <hi>Pelion</hi> upon <hi>Oſſa;</hi> but they ly further diſtant then at M. <hi>Calamies</hi> door, and M. <hi>Hudſons;</hi> as he is pleaſed to make the alluſion, or illuſion rather, <hi>vin.</hi> p. 35. One Kingdom may conſiſt of divers Ilands, if under the ſame King, and laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo may all the Churches in the world be one Church, though farre diſtant; and viſible, though not actually ſeen, becauſe the perſons and places are viſible, and the things wherein, and whereby they are conjoyned, as Profeſſion, Laws, Doctrine, Seals, Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are external, and ſo viſible. And though an aggregative body is not made up of the ſeveral parts conſidered ſeverally and apart, yet out of the exiſtence, and viſibility of them conjoyned, either phyſically or politically, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (according as the thing is) the exiſtence and viſibility of the whole will reſult, as I ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>And Sir, I cannot but right my ſelf from an injury which in your anſwer to this Objection, <hi>vind.</hi> p. 24. you offered me: by intimating bitingly, to delude your reader, and wrong M. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> (the licenſer of that Theſis) as if he were the Authour of it, or partly the Authour, or at the faireſt the inciter thereto. What other conſtruction can theſe words of you bear? <hi>A man-midwife may be father alſo.</hi> And another jerk you give to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>vind.</hi> p. 80. in theſe words <hi>Moſes mother was his nurſe alſo.</hi> But Sir, that which is mine I am not willing ſhould be charged upon any other; I owned it in print; and to put you and others out of doubt, I aſſure you that neither M. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> nor any other incited me thereto, neither ſo much as made or altered one ſentence in the whole <hi>Theſis.</hi> Neither was it of ſuch a texture as that you or any man elſe, ſhould ſuppoſe it had any other Authour or Authours, then a mean Countrey-Miniſter,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57278:72"/>
ſuch as I acknowledge my ſelf to be. You might have known who was the Authour thereof, if you would have been pleaſed to have come to our company, at the reading of it, as you were lovingly invited, out of deſire to enjoy your ſociety, for the learning and piety we conceived to be in you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> If the Church-Catholike or Oecumenical be one viſible Church, it is neceſſary that they ſhould all meet together at ſome times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not at all neceſſary, neither to the unity, nor yet to the viſibility of the Church. It is ſufficient that the perſons be viſible in their ſeveral places, and that they be combined together under the ſame head, by viſible laws and profeſſion, under the ſame viſible ſeal and enrowlment, walk viſibly in the ſame godly converſation before men, pray one for another, as fellow-members, rejoyce in the wel-fare, and mourn for the ill-fare one of another, and contribute aſſiſtance one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as occaſion is offered. As therefore it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the unity or viſibility of a kingdom or Empire, that they ſhould meet together ſometimes: ſo is it not needful for the whole Church: indeed there may be ſome conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in both, <hi>ad benè, vel optimum eſſe, ſed non ad eſſe ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This M. <hi>Ellis</hi> excepteth againſt, <hi>vin.</hi> p. 55. Firſt, he asketh whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever there were ſuch a kingdom in the world, that the members did not meet ſometimes, if it be not a meer viſible monarchy, as under Popery. If there be any liberty left to the Subjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let him ſhew that ever the four Monarchies did meet together reſpectively, either in their perſons or deputies, or delegates from every Province, yet that hindered not their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity nor viſibility. And his anſwer implyeth, that the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Monarchy under Popery did never meet. He makes it but a ſign of liberty to meet, not a ſign of viſibility. And for the point of liberty inherent in the ſubjects as their proper right, diſtinct from what is derived and given by Chriſt as their head; there was never any Monarchy ſo meerly depending on the will of the Monarch, as the Church-viſible on Chriſt, for the Church deriveth all its power from Chriſt, and hath all its
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57278:73"/>
laws given and impoſed only by Chriſt, without any vote of the Churches in the making of them. It is probable that the kingdoms under the four Monarchies had ſome enjoyment of their municipal laws, only might have ſome imperial general laws ſuperadded: but it is not ſo in this, for the whole Church (as a Church) hath no laws, but of Chriſts arbitrary donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Chriſtians are not ſubdued by Chriſt as Engliſhmen were by <hi>William the Conquerour,</hi> viz. on condition that he would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to enjoy their former rights, and the Laws of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> but abſolutely to receive Laws from him: And yet this can neither be thought tyranny in Chriſt, nor yet ſlavery in us, for Chriſts Laws are more beneficial to us, then any of our own making, and his ſervice is perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>And yet we reade of general Councels of the Church by their delegates, which were as it were a miniſterial Church-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: which in former times of the Church under Chriſtian Emperours were frequent; and there is no intrinſecal let in the Church that they do not meet ſo ſtill, but only extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal, and extraneous, by reaſon of the diviſions among the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Governours: but even in our daies a great part of that great body hath met, as in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> &amp;c. by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>Whitakers</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> acknowledge the meeting, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. to be a general Councel. The members were the Apoſtles, who were Paſtours of the Church-Catholike, and brethren out of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The work was to elect an Apoſtle, who was to be a Paſtor of the univerſal Church: and they that undertake and diſpatch ſuch a buſineſſe which concerns the extraordinary teaching and government of the whole Church, ſhould repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the whole Church-Catholike.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Ellis vin.</hi> p. 25. utterly denyeth that ever there was any <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Councel which might be ſaid to be the Church-Catholike, <hi>viz. ministerially.</hi> But I took <hi>general</hi> in the uſual ſenſe of it, and not preciſely conſidered. He knows the four Councels are known by the name of The four general Councels. And ſo himſelf cals them, <hi>vind.</hi> p. 15. l. 37. I took the term <hi>general</hi> in the ſenſe that we cal the four Monarchies, the Monarchies of the whole world,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57278:73"/>
and yet we know there were many countries that were never under them. And as <hi>Luke</hi> Act. 2.5. ſaith, there were dwelling at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Jews, devout men out of every nation under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and yet there were many Nations where Jews never dwelt, ſome of which were diſcovered lately. But let him look into <hi>Euſeb. de vita Conſtantini,</hi> lib. 3. and <hi>Socrates Scholaſt.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 8. and he ſhall finde from how many Countries the firſt Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> was gathered. <q>There were gathered (ſaith he) together into one, the chief Miniſters of God inhabiting all the Churches throughout all <hi>Europe, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> That ſacred Synod framed as it were by the handy-work of God, received alſo both Syrians and Cilicians, and ſuch as came from <hi>Phoenicia, Aegypt, Arabia, Palaeſtina, Thebais, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> There was alſo in this Synod the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Perſis,</hi> of <hi>Pontus, Gala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>(viz. Rome)</hi> by reaſon of his old age abſented himſelf, yet there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Presbyters, which ſupplyed his room. Divers things M. <hi>Ellis</hi> excepteth againſt that Councel, as ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe in the ſummoning of the members of it, without electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and delegation of the particular Churches. And that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> was the viſible head of it; and that he called for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops chiefly, if not only, which will not be pertinent here to anſwer. Something there might be extraordinary in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: for the civil and Eccleſiaſtical State not concurring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether until <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> haply there could not be a regular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. In extraordinary times and caſes, our brethren will grant ſomething may be done extraordinarily: as there is in the calling of this preſent Aſſembly, as is acknowledged by M. <hi>Gillespy.</hi> There were alſo others beſides Biſhops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Neither did <hi>Conſtantine</hi> either ſit as Preſident of it, nor preſume to be head: but confeſſeth himſelf to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: but by his civil ſanction he did confirm their decrees, and ſend them abroad. Neither is there any ground that in that or any other Councel, the members acted
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57278:74"/>
only each for his own particular Church that ſent him (as M. <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> ſuggeſterh) but the whole for the whole, as far as their dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge there is power given to every particular Church to rule it ſelf, and exerciſe the diſcipline of the Church for the being and well-being of it ordinarily. Yet ſo as it is a part of the whole Church, into which alſo the cenſures there paſſed, have influence. And on ſome great occaſions there may be cauſe to ferch help further, as <hi>Cranmer</hi> appealed to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councel. But if that extenſive power cannot be had, as now it is very difficult; then muſt the particular, national, provincial, claſſical, or congregational Church reſt in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive power that remains within its own limits; or alſo if they ſtand ſo as that they cannot combine with neighbours, or have recourſe unto them. Extraordinary caſes cannot be regulated by ordinary rules. And this I conceive is the reaſon why the Scripture hath not determined more particularly the Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Aſſemblies; but only giveth general rules that may be drawn to particulars, becauſe all Churches and ſeaſons are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of national or provincial Synods, in regard of many things that may be incident.</p>
                  <p>In ſome caſes alſo all civil power muſt reſt in one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if it were in a wilderneſſe, where there were no neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Towns or cities to which it might be joyned. Yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that it muſt be ſo in <hi>England,</hi> or any other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where there are Counties, Shires, Cities, great Towns, or a Parliament. Yea, I know not but a particular family may, yea, muſt be independent in ſuch an extraordinary caſe, both in Eccleſiaſtical and civil matters alſo: yet it follows not that there is ſuch an inherent right in every town or family all over the world, and that therefore particular Towns and families in <hi>England</hi> are debarred of an inherent priviledge belonging to them, becauſe neceſſity may put ſuch an Independency on ſome, in an extraordinary caſe; as by ſhipwrack, or being caſt into ſome Iland not inhabited.</p>
                  <p>Here M. <hi>Ellis</hi> chargeth me to ſay, that the power of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councel, (or of a Church-Catholike viſible) is <hi>but</hi> exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and <hi>only</hi> extenſive, and not intenſive, and the power of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57278:74"/>
the particular Churches is intenſive. But Sir, do as you would be done by. It is not fair dealing to note them as my words which were none of mine, nor my ſenſe. For firſt, I never conceived a general Councel to be the whole Church-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like viſible, but only an oecumenical, miniſterial or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative body of Officers, or Organs of the Church, much leſſe the prime Church to which the Ordinances and priviledges of the Church were firſt given, of which I ſpake, as appears in my ſecond part. Secondly, I never ſaid the power of a general Councel was <hi>only</hi> extenſive; for as the particular Officers have intenſive power over their particular Congregations, ſo hath a general Councel intenſive power alſo, but their power is larger in extenſion actually, then the particular Officers is, being Officers ſent from a larger part of the Church-Catholike, and intruſted by more, and acting for more then one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or one Elderſhip. This diſtinction M. <hi>Parker de polit. Eccl.</hi> lib. 3. p. 121. ſetteth down in theſe words. <q>Diſtinguo de poteſtate clavium, quae intenſiva aut extenſiva est.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> If there be a Church-Catholike viſible here on earth, it is fit it ſhould have a viſible head over them, that ſo the body and head may be of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was indeed uſed as a main argument by the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficians for the ſupremacy of the Pope. The avoiding whereof made our Divines ſo ſhy of granting a Church-Catholike viſible, but it was not neceſſary that they ſhould deny upon this ground, as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> conceives, <hi>Surv.</hi> p. 251. I ſay it is not neceſſary to grant a viſible head to the Church-Catholike viſible, no more then to a particular viſible Congregation, which our brethren hold to be a body of Chriſt. And though they call it a myſtical and ſpiritual body, yet that doth not imply it to be inviſible. The Sacraments are called myſteries, and myſtical, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are called ſpiritual, and yet are viſible, though the grace ſignified or conveyed by them to the Elect, is inviſible. They are ſpiritual in reſpect of the authour God, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57278:75"/>
ſubject about which they are, in oppoſition to natural and civil, and ſo our Eccleſiaſtical Courts were called ſpiritual, though indeed as they managed them they made them carnal and ſinful. The members of the particular Congregations are viſible members, and their union and confederation is viſible; and they are a viſible body, mixed of true beleevers and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, as <hi>Gerard, Whitakers, Cameron,</hi> and even M. <hi>Bartlet in his model,</hi> confeſſeth. And their communion is viſible, and yet there is no viſible head on earth required for them, and why then ſhould there be for the Church-Catholike? Such a head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether viſible or inviſible, preſent or abſent, as will ſerve a particular myſtical body of Chriſt, as M. <hi>Cotton</hi> cals a particular viſible Congregation, will ſerve the Church-Catholike viſible.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer further, that the Church-Catholike viſible hath a head of the ſame nature, conſiſting of body and ſoul, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lived in this viſible kingdom of grace, in the daies of his fleſh, and did viſibly partake in external Ordinances, though indeed now he be aſcended into his kingdom of glory, yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to be a man, and ſo viſible in his humanity as we are, though glorified and glorious, yet not leſſe viſible in himſelf for that, but rather more: and ceaſeth not to rule and govern his Church here below, for it is <hi>an everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> Eſay 9.7. As when King <hi>James</hi> was tranſlated from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and lived here, he did not ceaſe to be King of <hi>Scotland:</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Chriſt ceaſe to be the head of his Church, though he be tranſlated and aſcended to his other kingdom, the kingdom of glory. And as for a Vicar or Deputy here below, it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. We confeſſe the government of the Church in regard of the head is abſolutely Monarchical, but in regard of the Officers, it is Ariſtocratical.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond anſwer is excepted againſt, both by M. <hi>Ellis vind.</hi> p. 56. and M. <hi>Hooker Sur.</hi> p. 258. <q>It is inſufficient (ſaith M. <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>) for Chriſt is head inviſible, and thence our Divines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his body the Church to be myſtical alſo, and inviſible taken properly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That Chriſt is not only head of the inviſible compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which headſhip and body allude to the natural head and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57278:75"/>
which is indeed the Church in the moſt proper and prime ſenſe, but he is head alſo of the viſible company or Eccleſiaſtical body, in alluſion to a civil head or governour.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt not only affordeth inviſible communion to his inviſible members, but externally by Ordinances to both inviſible and viſible members of the Church, yet to both viſibly. For Chriſt by his Ambaſſadours, and in his written word ſpeaks externally to their ſenſes, and they ſpeak externally to him in praier and ſinging. And as he was once viſibly on earth in our nature, a viſible head of his Church: ſo alſo, if the millenary opinion be true, (which ſome of this way hold) he ſhall come again, and ſhall ſit and reign a thouſand years viſibly. But whether that opinion be true or no (which I much doubt) yet he ſhall come again viſibly, as the Sonne of man, at the end of the world, and take account of the managing of theſe Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and of the carriage both of Officers and private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and the elect ſhall be gathered together into heaven, and enioy him viſibly to all eternity, and he ſhall viſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the reprobates, and every eye ſhall ſee him. So that this is but an interval, wherein Chriſt though he be now viſible in himſelf, yet appears not to us viſibly, ordinarily, though he did to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Steven,</hi> even after his aſcenſion. Yet, now he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords viſible communion to his people by his Ordinances, and they do viſible ſervice unto him, though he reſideth not with them. If the abſence of the King make the kingdom inviſible, then <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is an inviſible kingdom.</p>
                  <p>M <hi>Hooker</hi> affirms this opinion to be not only untrue, but very dangerous, to hold that Chriſt as meer man conſiſting of body and ſoul is a viſible head of his Church. And thereupon citeth <hi>Whitakers</hi> words, that Chriſt did not reſide in the Church as a viſible Monarch, nor came into the world to ſet up a viſible Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not conceive that Chriſt as meer man conſiſting of body and ſoul is the head of the Church, either inviſible or political, but as God-man, yet that perſon was viſible, though but in one of his natures, and in but half of that neither, <hi>viz.</hi> his body. The viſibility of one nature makes viſibility to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of the whole perſon, elſe no man is viſible, for his ſoul
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57278:76"/>
is inviſible. It is the meaneſt half of him that is viſible, and ſo no earthly King ſhould be viſible. Chriſt is called <hi>God manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>And the word became fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father,</hi> Joh 1.14. <hi>We were eye-witneſſes of his majeſty,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.16. <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.1. I hope theſe ſpeeches are neither untrue nor dangerous And for his donative power and authority, Chriſt ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.27. that the Father hath <hi>given authority to execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becauſe he is the ſon of man, The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive ſinnes,</hi> and that was a kingly action. And the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by that man whom he hath ordained.</hi> It is true indeed all the vertue and power come from the deity to gather and perfect the Saints, forgive ſinnes, raiſe the dead, judge the world; and by his deity only he is preſent with us now, yet as man alſo he is head of his Church and not as God only; for had he been only God, he could not have been a ſutable head or ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> but that he became by becoming man, and taking our nature upon him. <hi>The ſeed of the woman muſt break the Serpents head.</hi> The governing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſedom of a King is in his inviſible ſoul, yet he is a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble King. It is true alſo that Chriſt came not in the daies of his fleſh as a viſible, temporal Monarch, in <hi>Davids</hi> civil throne, yet Chriſt confeſſeth then unto <hi>Pilate</hi> that he was a king, though his kingdom was not of this world, <hi>i. e.</hi> civil, to oppoſe <hi>Caeſars,</hi> yet it is in this world, and external in this world alſo. God over-ruled <hi>Pilate</hi> to ſet a true title over Chriſt on the Croſſe. <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth king of the Jews.</hi> As a King he had <hi>all power in heaven and earth given hem,</hi> Mat. 28.10, 19 and immediatly thereupon as a King he iſſues out his Commiſſion to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. It is not becauſe Chriſt died for all as a Prieſt, that this commiſſion is ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but becauſe all power in heaven and earth was given to him, therefore as a King he ſummons in all, even the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to yield obedience to his lawful authority, but only ſuch as

yield obedience and come in are ſaved by him. He ſet Officers and offices, and gave commandment to his Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.2. And appointed the form of Eccleſiaſtical proceedings in diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, in caſe of ſcandal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. And this is no other doctrine then our <hi>reverend Aſſembly</hi> hath ſet out, both in their larger and ſhorter <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> That Chriſt our redeemer executeth the offices of a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a King, both in his eſtate of humiliation and exaltation. Neither can I ſee any reaſon why Chriſt ſhould be denied to execute his kingly office while he was here below, any more then his Prieſtly or Prophetical. If he was then a King and had all power given him, he did not ſuſpend the execution of it, while he was on earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.17. neither doth <hi>Beza in conf. fid. ob.</hi> 5. <hi>art.</hi> 5. cited by M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> deny Chriſt to be head as man, though he acknowledge him to be head as God alſo. And though he ſaith, that <hi>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates that degree of dignity to none elſe:</hi> He by thoſe words excludeth the Pope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not Chriſts own humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; by which it is indeed that we come to our union with God.</p>
                  <p>All that can truly be alledged in this caſe is, that Chriſt is not now viſibly ſeen as King with our bodily eyes, nor can we come to him bodily, nor receive any verbal commands from his mouth, as we may from an earthly King. But how few ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have that priviledge in regard of their earthly Soveraigns! The legal commands are counted the Kings commands, and not his verbal only, nor chiefly. Yet we finde that Chriſt after his aſcention did in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. Chapt. write a letter by <hi>John</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 7. Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and reproves or commends and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them particularly: and in the inditing of it appears as a man to <hi>John:</hi> and uſeth arguments therein from things beti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him as man: as that he was dead and is alive again, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own bloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Though there be a Church-Catholike, yet it is not viſible, becauſe it is the object of our faith, it being an <hi>Article</hi> of our faith, <hi>I beleeve the holy Church-Catholike. Now faith is the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. Things ſeen are the object of ſenſe and knowledge, not of faith. For what a man ſeeth, how can he be ſaid to believe? faith and ſenſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57278:77"/>
are oppoſed each to other by the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If indeed we take the Catholike Church in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſenſe, for the elect paſt, preſent, and to come, as ſome do; the Church-Catholike is inviſible. Alſo the grace of ſuch as are inviſible members, is inviſible: but that is not the Church we are ſpeaking of: The Church we have in hand is the whole company of viſible believers in the world, conſidered as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwer, it is not true that that which is in it ſelf viſible cannot be the object of faith. Indeed that which is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeen is the object of that mans ſenſe and knowledge that ſeeth it: but that which is viſible, <hi>i. e.</hi> which may be ſeen, may be the object of faith to him that ſeeth it not actually. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is <hi>Orbis univerſus</hi> a whole world, but I never ſaw it, and yet it is viſible. I believe that there is a kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> and they are viſible, but I never ſaw them, nor am ever likely to ſee them. I believe there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations about the South-pole, but I never ſaw them, and yet they are as viſible as thoſe about the North pole: So I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Church viſible is now no longer included in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but is ſpread over many kingdoms, and may be into all, but I never ſaw it in the extent thereof, and yet it is viſible in it ſelf. The extent of place though it leſſens the viſibility, yet it takes it not away. I know this was an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an eminent Divine of ours againſt a Jeſuite, and it holds ſtrongly againſt the viſibility of the Church-Catholike taken in the firſt ſenſe, but not in our ſenſe. Yea, grant the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike to be a <hi>Genus,</hi> yet the argument reacheth it not, for a <hi>Genus</hi> is not the object of faith, but of knowledge, becauſe the aſſurance thereof ariſeth not from the credit of any ones word, but from our own underſtanding.</p>

Chapt. And yet many of theſe were combined Churches of many Congregations, and might be ſo all for ought I know. And we reade of the Elders of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> but whether fixed to particular Congregations or no I know not, to be ſure they ruled in common. Only we finde <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.1. Of <hi>Phaebe</hi> a ſervant of the Church at <hi>Cenchraea,</hi> which is the moſt probable example of a Congregational Church, as I ſaid before, but not certainly. But I ſhall take that for granted that particular Churches ought to be organized.</p>
                  <p>But with what Officers? whether with a Paſtor and a Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or with preaching and meer ruling-Elders? Or by whom theſe ought to be elected or ordained, or how maintained? Or whether their power be from Chriſt immediatly, or from the Congregation, the Officers being as their ſtewards and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? Or whether the Congregation hath votes and ſuffrages in the diſpenſing of cenſures, and the Elders but their mouth to pronounce and execute their cenſures, as he that ſits for judge and gives the charge at a Seſſions, or a chair-man at a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee is, in regard of the reſt of the Juſtices or whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to propound, gather their votes, and paſſe ſentence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly?
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57278:78"/>
whether their work in ſuch Eccleſiaſtical meetings be only to convene and diſſolve,<note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> and to bring things into order for the hearing of the reſt? are different queſtions, which are not to my purpoſe, and therefore I will not meddle with them.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing every part is or ought to be organized, the whole may be ſaid to be Organical in that ſenſe.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. It is ſimilar.</note> If all the <hi>ſpecies</hi> be be organized (ſuppoſing they were <hi>ſpecies</hi>) the <hi>genus</hi> in a <hi>logical conſideration</hi> muſt be ſaid to be organized, becauſe it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature of the <hi>species</hi> ſo to be. Much more if we conſider the ſeveral Congregations as members, as indeed they are.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe I ſaid that theſe particular Congregations thus organized, are ſimilar, integral parts of the whole, M. <hi>Ellis</hi> chargeth me with a contradiction to mine own end and ſcope, and diſagreeing with <hi>Apollonius, vind.</hi> 54.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he thinketh he hath caught me upon the hip of ſuch a contradiction againſt my ſelf and ſcope, and that I can come off no otherwiſe then with a <hi>Veniam<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        </expan> viciſſim,</hi> nor any otherwiſe be relieved but by the charitable benevolence of my readers ingenuity. But if there had been ſuch a palpable contradiction, it is a marvel that reverend, judicious M. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſhould not finde it, and ſhew it as well as he. If all the countries in the world had the ſame kinde of civil government, both offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and laws reſpectively, though not dependent, were it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to ſay they were ſimilar integral parts of the world? And if all the Corporations in a Kingdom (though organical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) were of the ſame conſtitution, and had the ſame Officers, as Maiors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would they not be ſimilar integral parts of the kingdom? yea, even in phyſical mixed bodies, as medicinal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions compounded of ſeveral ingredients, yet becauſe the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is alike in all parts they may be ſaid to be ſimilar parts of the whole. <hi>Materialia componentia ſunt diſſimilaria, partes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrales compoſiti &amp; conſtituti ſunt ſimilares.</hi> So the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike in regard of the conſtituent materials, or eſſential parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Officers and private Chriſtians, is diſſimilar, but in regard of the ſeveral Congregations conſtituted, which are integral parts of the whole, it is ſimilar becauſe they are ſimilar. I did not mean by ſimilar <hi>quarto modo ſimilare</hi> (as I may ſay) in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, as haply the pure element of fire is, but ſuch a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milarity
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57278:78"/>
as is conſiſtent with a mixture of ingredient materials. Every Congregation in reference to other Congregation is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar, being of a like conſtitution, but in reference to it ſelf it is diſſimilar, conſiſting of Officers and private Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>This aſſertion need not ſeem ſo harſh, ſeeing D. <hi>Ames</hi> as I ſhewed before aſſerteth the ſame. And M. <hi>Bartlet in his model,</hi> p. 45. confeſſeth the particular Churches to be ſimilar parts of the Church-Catholike: and ſaith the Independents have left it upon record that they are ſo, and for that cites, <hi>Ameſ. medul.</hi> c. 32. And M. <hi>William Sedgewick</hi> in his Sermon before divers of the Parliament, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. And chargeth the London-Miniſters for an untruth in affirming (in the preface of <hi>Jus divinum</hi>) that they deny it. But the charge is unjuſt; they only ſet down the difference between the Presbyterians and Independents there to be in this, that the Presbyterians hold that there is one general Church of Chriſt on earth, and that all particular Churches and ſingle Congregations are but as ſimilar parts of the whole: and the Independents (ſay they) hold that there is no other viſible Church of Chriſt, but only a ſingle Congregation, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one place to partake of all Ordinances. The London-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters affirm only that the Independents deny one general Church of Chriſt on earth, not the ſimilarity of particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. But it will neceſſarily follow that they deny them to be ſimilar parts, if they deny the whole to which the parts muſt relate. And if they make the whole Church a <hi>genus</hi> (as they do) then muſt they make the particular Churches <hi>ſimilar ſpecies,</hi> which is little leſſe then a contradiction, for the formality of a <hi>species</hi> lieth in diſſimilarity and difference from the oppoſite <hi>species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to ſhew that this aſſertion of the ſimilarity of particular Churches croſſeth mine own ſcope, M <hi>Ellis</hi> ſets down mine opinion, with a mark as if the words were mine own, which neither are my words nor my ſenſe, <hi>viz. That the Church (viſible Catholike) is an Organical, miniſterial, governing body,</hi> i. e. (ſaith <q>he) not ſuch a body as is the element of water and air, every part whereof is of the ſame nature, vertue and power in it ſelf conſidered, but ſuch a body as a man hath, which is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſuch a body as all Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57278:79"/>
are. Now this (ſaith he) contradicts plainly the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer both opinion and expreſſion; for if the Church-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like be a ſimilar body, and all Congregations alike, and the whole nothing differing in nature or conſtitution from the parts, then the Catholike viſible Church is no more the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church then a particular.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To let paſſe his unfair dealing with my ſelf (and others) in miſreciting my words.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid indeed the Church-Catholike was an <hi>Organical</hi> body, but not a miniſterial <hi>governing</hi> body. For the ſcope of my The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis was and is to prove the Church-Catholike as it conſiſts of Officers and private Chriſtians, to be the prime Church to which the Ordinances are given reſpectively, as the Officers or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate members are capable; and to particular Churches ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily. I ſpake not of the Organs or Governours only. The body of Officers is indeed a governing body, called a miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Church, but the whole Church either particular or general, is no governing body, no more then a whole Corporation or kingdom can be ſaid to be a governing body, but they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned bodies, and ſo is the Church both particular and general.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I finde the words miniſterial governing Church in M. <hi>Rutherford in his due right of Preſbyt.</hi> 177, 178, 179. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is clear that he takes it not in M <hi>Ellis</hi>'s ſenſe, but for a Church furniſhed with Officers, and having diſcipline and government exerciſed in it: for he was farre from making the body of the Church to be the receptacle of the keys, and having power of governing. He ſaith the keys were given for the Church, but not to the Church.</p>
                  <p>It is only a Scottiſh expreſſion not to be ſo expounded and ſtrained, as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> doth, who bendeth his whole reply againſt a ſenſe of it, which I beleeve was not M. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> meaning.</p>
                  <p>Neither did I make the whole to differ any thing in nature, conſtitution or power from the parts; but ſaid they have the ſame kinde of intenſive power, but in the Church-Catholike it is of larger extenſion. Similar bodies conjoyned exert their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er more intenſely and extenſively, then when ſingle. All the water of the Sea will cool and moiſten more and further then one drop; a great fire will warm, yea, burn more and further
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57278:79"/>
then a ſpark: a great heap of ſtones extends further and will weigh more then a little one. So all Churches (if they could meet) have no other power when met together, then a ſingle Church, but being combined, the power both reacheth further in extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of places, and it more auguſt and ſolemn, and to be the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpected and ſubmitted unto.</p>
                  <p>But this (he ſaith) croſſeth <hi>Apollonius,</hi> whom (ſaith he) I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but indeed I never ſaw his book, nor heard of it, until a good while after I had compoſed my Theſis, and then inſerted I think but 2. or 3. ſentences of his. <q>
                        <hi>Apollonius</hi> (ſaith he) ſaith that <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. is meant of an organical, miniſterial body, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in members, which M. <hi>Hudſon</hi> expounds to be meant of a ſimilar body whoſe parts are all alike.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are alike in the integrals, as I ſaid before, but not in the eſſentials. But where doth <hi>Apollonius</hi> deny the particular Congregations to be ſimilar integrals parts of the Catholike? There is therefore no diſagreement among the Presbyterians in this point (as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> ſuggeſteth, <hi>vin.</hi> 54.) that one of them would have one thing, another another.</p>
                  <p>But the main queſtion comes now to be diſcuſſed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. It is one Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical body.</note> 
                     <hi>viz Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole Church-Catholike viſible be one Organical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</hi> which if it can be made appear, will end the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
                  <p>The Church is diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Entitive</hi> and <hi>Organical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church viſible is called <hi>Entitive,</hi> not becauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace which is eſſential to an inviſible member, but from the reception and embracing the Chriſtian Catholike faith, which is eſſential to a viſible beleever. And it is called <hi>Organical,</hi> in reference to the Officers thereof, which are the Organs of the Church, or in regard of the Offices which Chriſt hath inſtituted to be in his viſible Church. This diſtinction halteth as much as that of the Church-viſible and inviſible: for the <hi>Organical</hi> Church is alſo <hi>Entitive,</hi> viz. it is of ſuch as have received and embraced the Chriſtian faith, and is made up of ſuch, and only of ſuch: yet there is a difference in notion, but not in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Indeed in ſome ſenſe a company of viſible beleevers may be ſaid to be a Church-Entitive, and not <hi>Organical,</hi> becauſe they are not actually under any particular Officers: as a company
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57278:80"/>
of viſible Chriſtians in <hi>New England</hi> inhabiting together to make a Congregation, but as yet have choſen no Officers, may in reference to other organized Congregations be ſaid to be inorganical, and entitive only: but this ſenſe is not the moſt proper ſenſe of the word. For if they be, then but a Church-entitive, then alſo after they have Officers, if thoſe particular Officers die, they ſhould return to be a Church-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titive only again, in the <hi>interim</hi> before they have choſen any new ones.</p>
                  <p>Now though in conſideration we may diſtinguiſh between the eſſence of beleevers, as beleevers embracing the Chriſtian faith, and their exiſtence under Officers, eſpecially under par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Officers: yet the exiſtence of viſible beleevers, members of the Church-Catholike, can hardly be without reference to Officers. For the miniſtery of the Officers is the uſual means of their converſion: and to be ſure they cannot be admitted to be actual members of the Church-Catholike by baptiſm, but by ſome of the Officers, though not conſidered as their particular Officers, yet Officers in general. And ſuch perſons as receive the doctrine of Chriſt which denominates them to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, are bound to receive his commands alſo, to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his Miniſters for their edification. And though they have no particular Officers, yet as they look upon the Church as a ſociety of men and fellow-members to whom they joyn themſelves in the general, though not as yet in any particular memberſhip: ſo they look upon the Miniſters as Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to whom they are to be ſubject in the Lord, to receive their doctrine, exhortations and reproofs, and from whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if they prove ſcandalous, heretical, infectious, or apoſtates, they muſt expect diſciplinary cenſures, though they be no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members, under a particular Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>There is a queſtion whether the Church or the Miniſters be firſt, becauſe the Miniſters are the inſtrumental cauſe of the converſion of the Church, and the Church of the choice of the Miniſters, which is ſomething like that Philoſophical queſtion, Whether the hen or the egge were firſt, for as the egge comes of a hen, ſo the hen comes of an egge. And as that is reſolved by the conſideration of the creation, and then God made the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57278:80"/>
hen firſt: ſo is this queſtion by conſideration of the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and ſetting up of the Evangelical Catholike Church; and then we finde that Chriſt ſet up the Officers firſt to convert men to be beleevers, and they being converted to the faith of Chriſt are bound to ſubmit themſelves to Chriſts Miniſters in the Lord. And becauſe they will ſtand in need of conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, teaching and ruling, which they cannot enjoy from Miniſters in general, as ſo conſidered: becauſe they are diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into ſeveral places for habitation, and take particular parts of Chriſts Church to watch over; therefore they are to deſire and endeavour to have ſome of Chriſts Miniſters to take the particular inſpection of them. But we know that at firſt they receive Baptiſm not from their own particular Miniſter, or not as ſo conſidered; for being newly converted into the Church, and not baptized, they cannot as I conceive be members of a particular Congregation, until after baptiſm, but they receive it as from one of Chriſts Miniſters in general, and are by him admitted into the viſible body the Church, and after this have liberty to chooſe under the inſpection of what Miniſters they will put themſelves. See more of this <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. <hi>S.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>Now before the proof of this aſſertion, it will be needful to explain a little what I mean by one Organical body; I doe not mean that there is one univerſal, viſible, actual ſociety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of all ſuch as are accounted or to be eſteemed Chriſtians, ſubjected actually to one or many univerſal, general, actual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors or guides, from whom ſubordinates muſt derive their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and power, and with whom they muſt communicate in ſome general ſacred things, which may make them one Church as the Jews were. And which general ſacred ſervices or duties can be performed by that univerſal head or heads, and that Church only.</p>
                  <p>Such an univerſal Chriſtian Church Chriſt never ordained, no, not in the daies of the Apoſtles, to whom the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry care of all the Churches was committed. Nor that all the whole Church ſhould be ſubjected to one ſupream Tribunal of Officers conſtantly erected, and continued among them. Nor yet to communicate with Chriſt himſelf (though in ſome ſenſe he may be ſaid to be a viſible head) in ſome worſhip to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

by all joyntly aſſembled at ſome eſpecial ſolemnity, as the Jews at the Paſſeover.</p>
                  <p>But an habitual, Politico-Eccleſiaſtical ſociety, body, flock, in one ſheepfold of the militant Church, in uniform ſubjection to the ſame Lord, the ſame Laws, in the ſame faith, and under the ſame viſible ſeal of Baptiſm, performing the ſame worſhip and ſervice in kinde: and though the members be diſperſed far and wide, yea, divided into ſeveral particular places, and ſecondary combinations of vicinities, for actual, conſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Ordinances (as particular Corporations in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is an accidental, not eſſential relation to them as ſubjects of the Kingdom) yet ſtill thoſe Ordinances, admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ejections, have influence into the whole body, as it is a polity: and the members indefinitely may of right communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate one with another in any place, or any company of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, though every perſon ſo meeting but occaſionally, may be of a ſeveral particular Church, and the Miniſter diſpenſing, a particular Paſtor to none of them all, yea, though none of them all be fixed members of any particular Congregation, nor the Miniſter diſpenſing fixed to no particular Congregation neither: by vertue of their general memberſhip in the viſible body and kingdom of Chriſt, and of the habitual indefiniteneſſe of the Miniſters office, and the common donation of the Ordinances by Chriſt to his whole viſible Kingdom, and to all the ſubjects and members thereof, which have a common freedom therein. And in this ſenſe the word Church is taken in Scripture. <hi>His bodies ſake which is the Church, whereof I Paul am made a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. The houſe of God which is the Church.</hi> Now becauſe there is no ſuch civil ſociety or kingdom that will in every thing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel this: but there uſe to be ſome general offices and officers, and ſome inferiour ſubordinate, receiving power and authority by deſcention, derivation, or ſubordination, and the inferiour Officers of leſſe extent of place and power then the ſuperiour. As the Lord chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> is above inferiour Juſtices, and his warrant can reach all perſons in all the Counties of the Kingdom, and there be conſtant Courts of Kings bench and Common Pleas for judicature for all the Subjects of the whole Kingdom (though haply it was not ſo in the four Monarchies)
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57278:81"/>
this make men ſtumble at the name and notion of a Church-Catholike viſible. But as in other things Chriſts Kingdom is neither of this world, not like unto worldly polities, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this. But every Miniſter of the Church in his particular place ſerveth the Church-Catholike viſible in admitting mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to general freedom in it, and ejecting out from general communion, prayeth publikely for the whole body, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his particular charge, in reference to, and ſo as may ſtand with the good of the whole body, whereof his Congregation is but a member. And the Ordinances therein adminiſtred, are the Ordinances given to the whole, not as to a <hi>genus,</hi> which is but a notion, and can have no Ordinances, but as to a ſpiritual kinde of an habitual organical body and polity; as to a ſort of men ſo and ſo qualified, bound up in an union and unity of the ſame head, laws, ſeals, worſhip and communion.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſame arguments which prove the Church-Catholike an Integral, will ſerve to prove it one organical body alſo,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> and therefore I ſhall take ſome of them into conſideration again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head and in this notion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will appear by the names and metaphors whereby the Church-Catholike is called and ſet out in Scripture, which are taken from things which are not only each of them an Integral, but each of them one Organical body: and in <hi>eâ formali ratione</hi> lyeth the analogy between them and the Church.</p>
                  <p>It is compared unto a natural body, which is an organical integral having many members and Organs, which though they lie indeed in the ſeveral members, yet are Organs of the whole, and the ſeveral members members of the whole, and doe their ſeveral actions, and perform their ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for the good of the whole, and ſympathize together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body: ſo alſo is Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is not meant of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> only, but of the Catholike Church, becauſe it is the whole body to which Chriſt is the head, and Chriſts perſon as the head of the whole, and this whole body is called Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> myſtically,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57278:82"/>
the whole receiving denomination from the better part, the head.</p>
                  <p>And ſo M. <hi>Bartlet</hi> takes it in his <hi>Model,</hi> pag. 35. for the whole Church. And ſo all Expoſitors that I have met with, except ſome few of late, who to avoid the dint of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have it meant of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church. But it will ſound very harſh to make Chriſt and the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to be called Chriſt, when they are but the head, and a part of Chriſts body. It is the body whereof <hi>Paul</hi> was a member, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>We are all baptized,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> puts in himſelf and all beleevers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But this is meant of the inviſible company of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, but it is ſpoken of them as viſible, becauſe it is brought in there to ſhew the diverſities of gifts, offices, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and adminiſtrations in the viſible Church: there is an eye and an ear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mentioned, and the Officers of the Church named; now there are no Officers of the inviſible Church as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, nor different adminiſtrations; as they are members of the inviſible body they are all ſimilar, and have the ſame ſtanding and operations of their general calling as Chriſtians, not as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And many that have theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of the holy Ghoſt (which are by the Spirit of Chriſt) and the Offices there mentioned, were not inviſible members of Chriſt, yet were not only members, but Officers in this body there ſpoken of. It is alſo the viſible body there meant, becauſe the 2. external ſeals, <hi>viz. Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> are ſpecified in <hi>v.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. as means and ſigns of this union in one body, and they are viſibly adminiſtred.</p>
                  <p>There is an inviſible body of Chriſt and a viſible, the inviſible is in organical, the viſible organical; the inviſible while they are in the viſible Church are viſible members thereof, and ſo put on the relation of Officer and private member. It is true, ſome things are ſpoken of the whole in reference to the better part, the inviſible number; and as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> profeſſed themſelves to be of the inviſible body, ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks of them, and to them, as if they were as they ought to be, and at leaſt made a ſhew as if they were. But that the place is meant of an organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57278:82"/>
body as one, is out of queſtion, and that the analogy between the Church and ſuch a body, lay in the unity and organicalneſſe, is as clear.</p>
                  <p>The like is ſpoken <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4, 5. <hi>For as we have many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in one body, and all members have not the ſame office; ſo we being many are one body in Chriſt, and every one members one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> It is the Church-Catholike, not <hi>Roman</hi> particular Church; <hi>Paul</hi> puts in himſelf, yet had never been at <hi>Rome</hi> then. It is organical, for the Officers are there enumerated. It is one, for there is a ſympathy of members ſpoken of. To this purpoſe is that of <hi>Salmaſ. Retinebitur <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> inter omnia membra Dominici corporis,</hi> i. e. <hi>Eccleſiae, quae niſi una ſit non poteſt eſſe vera,</hi> Appar. p. 281.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it is ſet out by a political body. Sometimes it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>kingdom of heaven,</hi> as I ſhewed before out of many places of Scripture. Now a Kingdom is one Organical body; for ſo many men living together within the ſame limits make not a Kingdom, but as it is combined by the ſame Laws, under one Governour or Government. In the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> this one Kingdom ſince, under one King and body of laws, were ſeven Kingdoms. Now if the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike bears ſuch an analogy to one Kingdom as to be called a Kingdom, it is from this that it is one organized Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo called a <hi>city,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and as it is reformed it is called <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> and the members both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are called fellow-citizens, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. Now a City is one Organical body under one common government: otherwiſe ſo many houſes or ſtreets and inhabitants being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would not make them a City. Sometimes the buildings and inhabitants, which if under one government would make one city and Corporation, being great and near, and haply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous, yet wanting a charter to make them a Corporation are none; yea, by difference of Charter, Government and chief Governours are two Cities as <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The Church-Catholike therefore being one city is one organical body.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it is ſet out ſometimes by one martial or military
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57278:83"/>
body, and is called an <hi>Army terrible with banners,</hi> Cant. 6. 10. which by ſome is interpreted Church-cenſures. M. <hi>Cotton</hi> indeed expounds it of the Church of the Jews, when they ſhall be called home by converſion to the Chriſtian faith; to be ſure it is the Church-militant. Now an Army is one organical body under one General, and the ſame Laws martial, though quartered in divers places: therefore ſo is the Church-Catholike.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo ſet out by an <hi>Oeconomical body,</hi> a family or houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. Now a family is one Organical body, wherein are Governours or a Governour, and governed, an husband, father, or maſter; and therefore ſo is the Church-Catholike, elſe the analogy ſhould not hold. All theſe metaphors and many more, whereby the Church-Catholike is ſet out, ſhew it one viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, organical body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Church-Catholike viſible is one ſociety virtually and habitually, appears, becauſe by Baptiſm where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever adminiſtred, the baptized viſible beleever is admitted a member not of the particular Church among whom he was baptized, nor to bear any ſpecial relation to the Miniſter bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing him, that he muſt take a ſpecial inſpection over him as one of his particular flock and charge, but into the whole general body of Chriſts kingdom viſible. For, as I ſhewed before, there was Baptiſm adminiſtred as the ſeal of the general covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore particular Congregations were ſet up. See more of this, <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. <hi>S.</hi> 2. and <hi>S.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>And alſo becauſe by excommunication a perſon is not caſt out of that Congregation only where the cenſure was paſt, but out of general communion with all other Churches in the world, even the whole viſible body of Chriſt. Certificates indeed we finde in Scripture to others, of their excommunication, that ſo others might avoid communion with them. As of the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. And ſo we reade alſo of certificates of Apoſtates, who it is like were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. As of <hi>Phigellus</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.15. And of <hi>Hyntentus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> a Tim. 2.17. The former of which was encommunicated, and it is probable the latter alſo, by the ſame reaſon. The like certificate we finde again of <hi>Alexander,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.14, 15. But no new act of excommunication
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57278:83"/>
paſt upon them any where elſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> having excommunicated <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> an Arian, writes an Epiſtle to certifie it to all other Miniſters. <hi>Chariſſimis honoratiſſimiſque fratribus, qui ubique gentium ſunt nobiſcum in Eccleſiae miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio conjuncti</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Socrat. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Nine Biſhops excommunicated <hi>Jovius</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> and that excommunication by <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as valid. The like we finde of <hi>Novatus</hi> excommunicated at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Cornelius</hi> and a Councel there, and it was certified to <hi>Fabius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and approved by him, and by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to whom the Epiſtles came. <hi>Euſeb.</hi> lib. 6. cap. 35. And <hi>Santo ſatenus</hi> excommunicated at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> was ſo accounted of the whole world, <hi>Niceph.</hi> 6.28. The <hi>Novatians</hi> excommunicated in <hi>Africk</hi> are ſo held at <hi>Rome.</hi> Cyp. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. and 13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It appears to be one organical body by the identity of the external Covenant, charter, promiſes, and laws of the whole Church. The Covenant, charter, and promiſes, are but one grant, not one Covenant in kinde and many <hi>species</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but one individual Covenant of grace granted to the whole Church. This is not the Covenant whereby particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations are ſaid to be conſtituted, but the whole body. The Churches conſtituted by particular Covenants are alterable, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, extinguiſhible (as M. <hi>Norton</hi> confeſſeth, p. 30.) which this is not: they are many and particular Covenants, this one and general: they are accidental, humane, arbitrary, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added; this eſſential, divine, neceſſary, and prime. And though this Covenant may ſeem but to belong to the Church as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titive, yet the Laws which are alſo one viſible ſyſteme, argue it to be organical, becauſe they relate to Officers and diſcipline: and they binde all not only <hi>vimateriae,</hi> but as proceeding from the ſame fountain and authour, the King of the whole Church, not <hi>quà</hi> particular members, but <hi>quà</hi> members of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It appears by the general right of communion,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57278:84"/>
that all the members have habitually and indefinitely to joyn in, as providence offereth opportunity, though not caſt into a Congregational combination, as all cannot be. Any viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever under the ſeal of Baptiſm only, hath an inherent right to worſhip with any other viſible Chriſtians in confeſſion, petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thankſgiving, and praiſe; and to prophecy with them in the Apoſtles ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> joyn with them in partaking of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, to ſing with them, and receive the Lords Supper with them, and to be entreated by any Miniſter as an Ambaſſadour of Chriſt to be reconciled, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and is bound to ſubmit to the doctrinal admonitions and reproofs of any Miniſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word: and the reaſon why any Miniſter may not paſſe a judicial cenſure alſo, if there be cauſe (ſeeing the keys are commenſurable) is not becauſe he wants habitual power in diſcipline, at well as doctrine, but becauſe that is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a Court of Elders, and a ſtrange Miniſter wants a call to joyn with any ſuch Court, to bring his habitual power into act: yet our brethren will non-communion or deny com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a ſtranger, if they have any thing againſt him, which is virtually a ſuſpenſion of him; yea, if they have not poſitive aſſurance by teſtimony (not of his being in the general Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for that is requiſite, but) of his being a fixed member of ſome other Congregation which they approve of, not only for having the eſſentials of a Church, but as a pure Church: for upon that ground they deny the communion to ſome members of our Churches that go over with certificates (though not to members of their own Churches) becauſe they judge us as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure. Indeed certificates are requiſite from ſtrangers to notifie their general right by being in the general Covenant, and to notifie their perſonal innocency from errour or ſcandal which might debar them.</p>
                  <p>But they only declare a right, they give none: neither doth their right proceed from the memberſhip of the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, from whence they come, but from the general, which is implyed in their particular memberſhip, becauſe Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conſiſt only of ſuch; and they are witneſſes of his godly converſation, he having lived with them.</p>
                  <p>As for judicial, Eccleſiaſtical cenſures, I confeſſe it is moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57278:84"/>
to turn the accuſed perſon, and his accuſations to his own Congregation, where an Elderſhip hath taken the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſpection of him, and have power in <hi>actu ſecundo</hi> already called forth to deal with him: but ſuppoſe they will not, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, or he will not return, but abide ſtill in another place; or ſuppoſe he be not a fixed member in any Congregation, but a wandring ſtar, and yet is a baptized perſon, and is very ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or very erroneous, and fit to infect the perſons among whom he converſeth; ſhall there be no remedy for that Congregation? For ought I know, they may put their general, habitual power into act, and upon ſufficient witneſſe proceed againſt him, and finding him obſtinate may excommunicate him, as well as a civil Officer will keep the kings peace in his own Town, by clapping an unruly, riotous, or traiterous ſtranger by the heels, if he take him within his limits.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I might argue alſo from the oppoſition of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the Church, both Satan and perſecutours, who oppoſe it not eſſentially only, but politically; their ſpite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Officers and Organs of the Church, not only <hi>quà</hi> Chriſtians, but <hi>quà</hi> Miniſters, not <hi>quà</hi> Miniſters of this or that particular Congregation, but <hi>quà</hi> the Miniſters of the Church, and not only as diſpenſers of Word and Sacraments, but as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of cenſures eſpecially for they do moſt uſually gaul men, and move their anger. They look upon the Church as one body, and upon Miniſters as Officers of the Church in a general conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and ſo may we.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note> It appears by the indefiniteneſſe of the office of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: which I reſerved for the laſt, becauſe I ſhall dilate a little more upon it then the former, And indeed upon this hinge hangeth the whole queſtion of the Organical integrality of the Church Catholike viſible. And turn the queſtion which way you will, it will reſt on this center, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be a Miniſter to any but his own Congregation?</p>
                  <p>I finde M. <hi>Ellis</hi> affirming that a Miniſter is an Officer only to his own Congregation, <hi>vind.</hi> p. 8. And the anſwer of the Elders of ſeveral Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> unto 9. Poſitions, <hi>p.</hi> 8. Their words are theſe, <q>If you mean by Miniſterial act, ſuch an act of authority and power in diſpenſing of Gods Ordinances as a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57278:85"/>
Miniſter doth perform to the Church, whereunto he is called to be a Miniſter, then we deny that he can ſo perform any Miniſterial act to any other Church but his own, becauſe his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice extends no further then his call.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So M. <hi>Beſt</hi> in his <hi>Church-Plea</hi> p. 30 ſaith, Officers of Churches may be helpful to other Churches as Chriſtians, but not as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. To the ſame purpoſe M. <hi>Bartlet</hi> in his <hi>model,</hi> p. 69. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears they ſuppoſe the Ordination of a Miniſter to his office, is limited to the particular Congregation that call him. Indeed the call of the people exerts or cals forth the exerciſe of his office unto them in particular conſtantly; but his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his office is more general, and giveth him habitual power <hi>in actu primo,</hi> to exerciſe and perform the acts belonging to his office elſewhere upon a call. Chriſt giveth the office, and hath annexed power of diſpenſing his Ordinances: the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery miniſterially admit this or that man into it, not as a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of that particular Congregation, for they may none of them belong unto it, but as a Presbytery of Chriſts Miniſters having a call to give that Ordination in a regular way: and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, by deſire and election give a call to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this power among them, <hi>pro his &amp; nunc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Habitu &amp; poteſtate omnes Epiſcopi ſunt Epiſcopi cujuſvis in orbo vel paraecia, vel provinciae, quia in quavis apti ſunt, habiles, &amp; idonei exercere Epiſcopalia ſua munera, quando illuc legitimè vocantur, ac mittamtur.

Def. Eccl. Aug. c. 28.</p>
                  <p>Now that a Miniſter is a Miniſter and ſo habitually in office to more then his own Congregation, and therefore indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all the whole Church, will appear by theſe proofs. Firſt, becauſe the donation of the keys, and the inſtitution and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Evangelical Miniſtery was in reference to the whole. <hi>Go teach all Nations, and baptize them.</hi> Whenas yet there was no diſtinction of Congregations. <hi>God ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28.

they did at firſt in the wilderneſſe ſerve all the Tribes <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim,</hi> as one body of Officers over one combined large Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but afterwards when the Tribes were diſperſed in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> the Levites were diſperſed among all the Tribes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed their office of teaching and judging in the ſeveral places where they dwelt; yet this diveſted them not of their general habitual power, this made not their office to ſtand in relation to the particular city or Synagogue vvhere they did conſtantly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: and when they removed from place to place, as the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Levite, <hi>Jud.</hi> 17.8. did, they ſtill retained their habitual of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and power, and needed no new conſecration, but by vertue of their office did exerciſe the acts belonging to it where they had their particular ſtation and call.</p>
                  <p>So is it with the Evangelical Miniſtery of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: a Miniſter of the Goſpel bears a double relation, one to the Church-Catholike indefinitely, another to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation over which he is ſet for the conſtant exerciſe of his office. And if he removes to another place, he needs no new Ordination; for that continueth and abideth ſtill upon him; it being to the eſſence of his office, and not in reference either to the place from whence he cometh, or to which he goeth only. A Phyſician or Lawyer needeth no new licenſe, or call to the Bar, though they remove to other places, and have other patients and clients. The Juſtice of peace who is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the whole County, though he exerciſed it in one part of the County, while he lived there, yet if he removes to the other end of the County, he needeth no new commiſſion to execute his office there, where he never did before, becauſe it was habitual to the whole County, though actually exerciſed where he lived; ſo though a Miniſter removes, he needeth no new Ordination, but a new call to the exerciſe of his office there, no more then a private Chriſtian by removing into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregation, needeth a new Baptiſm, becauſe neither Ordination nor Baptiſm ſtand in relation to the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but the Church-Catholike. As he that is admitted a freeman in any Hall of any Company in <hi>London,</hi> is admitted a freeman of the whole City, as well as of that Company: and he that by reaſon of his birth hath right to be baptized in any
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57278:86"/>
Congregation, is admitted a member of the whole ſociety of the Church-Catholike viſible, as well as of that Congregation: ſo he that is ordained a Miniſter, as by the occaſion of the call of a particular Congregation he is ordained their particular Miniſter, ſo alſo is he ordained a Miniſter of Chriſt and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and Church in general. <q>Ordination (ſaith M. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>) maketh a man a Paſtor under Chriſt formally and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, the peoples conſent and choice do not make him a Miniſter, but their Miniſter, the Miniſter of ſuch a Church: he is indefinitely made a Paſtor for the Church. <hi>Ruth. peaceab. plea.</hi> 263.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to the ſame purpoſe it is that M. <hi>Ball</hi> ſaith. <q>A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter choſen and ſet over one ſociety, is to look unto that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple committed to his charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he is a Miniſter in the Church univerſal: for as the Church is one, ſo is the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, of which every Miniſter (ſound and Orthodox) doth hold his part. And though he is a Miniſter over that flock which he is to attend, yet he is a Miniſter in the Church-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. The function or power of exerciſing that function in the abſtract, muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the power of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it concretely, according to the divers circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of places. The firſt belongeth to a Miniſter every where in the Church, the latter is proper to the place and people where he doth miniſter. The lawful uſe of the power is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Congregation ordinarily; the power it ſelf is not ſo bounded. In ordination Presbyters are not reſtrained to one or other certain place, as if they were to be deemed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters there only, though they be ſet over a certain people. And as the Faithful in reſpect of their community between them, muſt and ought to perform the offices of love one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, though of different ſocieties; ſo the Miniſters in reſpect of their communion, muſt and ought upon occaſion to perform Miniſterial offices toward the faithful of diſtinct ſocieties. <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of new Church. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</note> It appears by the ſubject matter whereabout the office of the Miniſtery is exerciſed, <hi>viz,</hi> the Ordinances of God, the Word and Sacraments, and Praier: the good news of the Goſpel, the profers, promiſes and precepts, which equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to all parts of the Church-Catholike. Therefore their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ſet out indefinitely, in reference unto the ſubject matter of it, and not the people to whom they diſpenſe them. A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is an Ambaſſadour of Jeſus Chriſt, and is in office habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to the whole Church: and though he be ſet to lie leiger in a particular Church, yet the ſubject of his office reacheth to the whole Church, and not that place only; yea, to all that are capable of reconciliation, for the Miniſtery is the Miniſtery of reconciliation; and even when he delivereth his Embaſſage in his own Church, he is to deliver both profers, promiſes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts indefinitely to ſtrangers of other Congregations, yea, of forreign nations, if they come into his Congregation. Suppoſe a Mayor of a Corporation ſhould ſend abroad his Serjeants to ſummon the whole Corporation to a general Court, and for expediency ſhould ſend one into one ſtreet, another into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a third into a third ſtreet: if any of theſe ſerjeants in their walks ſhould meet a freeman that dwelleth in another ſtreet, ought he to forbear to ſummon him, becauſe he dwels not in his particular walk, ſeeing he is an indefinite Officer to the whole
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57278:87"/>
Corporation, or is that ſummons without authority, becauſe the man dwels out of his particular limits, ſeeing the buſineſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all? Surely no, he ought to exert his general, habitual power of his office, and ſummon him. So ſeeing Gods meſſage is general to all, though the Miniſters (who are indefinite Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers) be ſetled in particular Congregations for expediency, yet they have power by vertue of their office to deliver it to any Chriſtian that God offers them an opportunity to preach unto. It is unreaſonable, that ſeeing the meſſage is indefinite, and concerns all in general, the commiſſion to deliver it ſhould be but particular. But I ſhall touch upon this in the ſecond queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It appears by the end of the Miniſterial function, <hi>viz.</hi> to encreaſe and edifie the body of Chriſt, not only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible body but the viſible alſo, by converting ſuch as do not as yet beleeve the Goſpel. And this was a great part of the work of the Miniſters in the primitive times: but how could they baptize thoſe they had converted, when the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts were dead, if they had power to baptize only their own members? And this work, as there is occaſion offered, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on Miniſters ſtill, for the office of the Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts is ceaſed, and yet many remain ſtill out of the Church. Indeed while the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> conſtitute Churches of members already baptized, this difficulty appears not; but if they come to convert natives, how ſhall they be baptized but by an Officer of the Church-Catholike? for they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of no Congregation, either they muſt admit them mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their own Congregation, and then baptize them, as their members, as I perceive their practice is, for which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice we finde no precept or precedent or intimation in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or elſe baptize them into the Church-Catholike, and then admit them members of their particular Congregations, and yet that will not ſtand with this opinion: or elſe they muſt grant them liberty to gather into a Church-Entitive (as ſome call it) and ſo make them capable of chooſing Officers, and of being a political body before they be baptized; but neither will this ſtand with our brethrens principles: but ſhould this latter be granted, who ſhall ordain a Paſtor over them? Shall unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57278:87"/>
perſons lay on their hands on them? See more of this, <hi>Q.</hi> 2. <hi>S.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the feeding and edifying of the body already convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, requires that this power of the miniſterial function ſhould be indefinite, for the miniſter of any particular Congregation through ſickneſſe or abſence, or the like occaſions, may not be able to afford ſufficient ſpiritual food to his own people, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Word, Sacraments, nor diſcipline, without the help of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle fellow-laboures, or a combined, claſſical Elderſhip. What ſhall become of a Congregation in the intervals between the death of a former Paſtor and the election of another? or who ſhall ordain him if he be elected? ſeeing all Officers of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations in the world are but as private men to them, by this opinion.</p>
                  <p>The end of the Miniſterial function is threefold, to convert into the viſible Church, to convert into the inviſible Church, and to edifie ſuch as are converted. Now this opinion cuts the two former ends quite off; for they ſuppoſe them both viſibly and inviſibly converted, before they think them fit matter for a Church, and ſo before admiſſion into a particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then reſtrain the Miniſters office only to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation ſo conſtituted, ſo that his work is only to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie and govern ſuch as are ſuppoſed to be truly godly, and train up their children. And by conſequence it muſt follow that all converſion muſt be by men out of office, or at leaſt as ſo conſidered. But <hi>Pro.</hi> 9 3. Wiſedom ſends out her maidens to call in thoſe that are without, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſimple and that want underſtanding. The Miniſters by vertue of their office may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and entreat and ſummon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, It appears from the actions which every particular Miniſter doth perform, both in his own Congregation and out
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57278:88"/>
of it. Every Miniſter doth in his own Congregation ſerve the Church-Catholike, by admitting members into the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and by preaching the word to ſtrangers that come to his Congregation, both fixed members of other Congregations, and ſuch as are not fixed in any, and adminiſtring the Lords Supper to members of other Congregations, and in other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations by preaching or adminiſtring the ſeals there, upon a deſire. And by excommunication they eject not only out of their own, but out of the whole. They alſo can keep lectures in other Congregations frequently. If it be objected, That this is occaſionally done, and a charitative act and not an act of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. I anſwer, indeed charity and neceſſity may be the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the performance thereof <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> but that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enable them to do it, if their office did not give them right and power habitually thereunto, no more then to private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable what M. <hi>Ball</hi> in his <hi>Trial of the new Church-way</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 80. <q>That to ſuppoſe a Miniſter to be a Miniſter to his own Congregation only, and to none other ſociety whatſoever, or to what reſpect ſoever, is contrary to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice of the univerſal Church, and tendeth to deſtroy the unity of the Church, and that communion which the Church of God may and ought to have one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if he be not a Miniſter in other Churches, then are not the Churches of God one, nor the Miniſtry one, not the flock which they feed one, nor the communion one which they had each with others. Again <hi>p.</hi> 90. he ſaith, If a Miniſter may pray, preach, and bleſſe another Congregation in the name of the Lord, and receive the Sacrament with them, we doubt not but he being thereunto requeſted by conſent of the Paſtor and the Congregation, he may lawfully diſpenſe the ſeals among them, as need and occaſion require. That diſtinction of preaching by office, and exerciſing his gifts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when it is done by a Miniſter, and deſired of none but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and that in ſolemn, ſet, conſtant Church-Aſſemblies, we cannot finde warranted in the word of truth, and therefore we dare not receive it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Miniſters are <hi>the light of the world,</hi> and though they ſtand
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57278:88"/>
like a light upon a particular Candleſtick, yet are occaſionally to enlighten all that they can, either that come to them, or that they occaſionally go among. Reverend M. <hi>Norton</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſaith, this is <hi>mediantibus candelabris Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum.</hi> His words are theſe, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>pa.</hi> 91. <q>Nobis ergo judicibus, Miniſtri ordinarij virtute muneris Eccleſiaſtici, ſunt paſtores certis Eccleſijs, &amp; mediantibus candelabris Eccleſiarum, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri omni creaturae, pro occaſione data, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> But this conceſſion is too narrow: for every Miniſter giveth light to others, not only as he ſtandeth in his own Candleſtick, <hi>viz.</hi> when others come to him; but alſo out of his Candleſtick, when he goeth to them. And when he preacheth or adminiſtreth Sacraments abroad, he doth it not as the Miniſter of ſuch a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but of the Church-Catholike; for the particular Congregation hath nothing to do to ſend an Officer to exerciſe his office in another Church, if it be confined and peculiar to that particular Congregation only, no more then a Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can ſend their Mayor to exerciſe his office in another Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, no not <hi>charitativè.</hi> It is therefore <hi>mediante officio ſive munere,</hi> by reaſon of the indefiniteneſſe of his office, not of his particular ſtation and relation, that he can diſpenſe the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to other Congregations. M. <hi>Norton</hi> p. 80. acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that a Miniſter hath <hi>poteſtatem exercendi actus officij chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tativè, &amp; modo debito, in aliis Eccleſiis,</hi> and that this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial power whereby he exerciſeth ſuch acts, in an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power, <hi>p.</hi> 81. and that it is Eccleſiaſtical, not only in regard of the diſpenſer and adminiſtrer (as it is when he preacheth to heathens) but in regard of the receivers or people to whom he doth diſpenſe; and that Churches <q>non tantum ſub ratione Chriſtian â exercent communionem Chriſtianam, ſed etiam quâ Eccleſiae exercent communionem Eccleſiasticam inter ſeipſas, &amp; in ſeipſis ad invicen: quare etiam Miniſtri, praecipuè cum ſint partes ejuſdem totius organici, etiam quà Miniſtri, actus miniſteriales officii in Eccleſii<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> non exercerent?</q> And even from this conceſſion of his (as I conceive) will neceſſarily follow that every Miniſter hath an indefinite, habitual, Eccleſiaſtical power, by vertue of his office in the whole Church-Catholike viſible <hi>in toto eodem organico,</hi> which if it may be brought into
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57278:89"/>
act and exerciſe by charity, then much more by neceſſity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, miſſion or delegation, and if for the exerciſe of one key, why not of another, ſo it be in a due manner? They are the <hi>Stewards of the myſteries of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1. and though by particular aſſignment they diſpenſe the Ordinances to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular company of Chriſts family, yet may not deny them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the family that have the ſame right thereto. They are <hi>spiritual fathers,</hi> and do not only beget their own people to Chriſt miniſterially, but ſtrangers alſo. They are Chriſts <hi>ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,</hi> and are to neglect none of Chriſts ſheep, as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is offered, though they have a particular charge of a ſet flock.</p>
                  <p>When M. <hi>Ellis</hi> preached before the Parliament, did he preach as a private Chriſtian, a gifted brother, or as a Miniſter? Surely they ſummoned him as a Miniſter, and heard him as a Miniſter: for they could have found many able Gentlemen members of Parliament, Lawyers or Citizens, who could have ſpent an hour or two in praier, and expoſition, and exhortation, but they never ſummoned any ſuch to perform that work. Or had they ſummoned him to have been a member of the Reverend Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, would he have acted there as a private man, or as a Miniſter? Or do the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſenting brethren ſit there as private men? or keep Lectures in <hi>London</hi> as private men?</p>
                  <p>Indeed skill, fitting endowments and willingneſſe give a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to be called to the office, but Ordination and miſſion giveth habitual power, and a call giveth occaſion of exerciſe thereof, and of drawing forth that power and office into act.</p>
                  <p>A private ſouldier may have as much skill to leade a Troop as a Captain, but he cannot do it authoritatively without a commiſſion: ſo haply many private Chriſtians are able to preach and govern in the Church, by reaſon of their skill, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wiſedom and faithfulneſſe, but cannot do it authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, having no commiſſion by office thereunto. And ſhould ſuch private man paſſe the cenſure againſt a ſcandalous brother that the Elders would do, yet it is not Eccleſiaſtical binding, yea, though ſuch a ſcandalous perſon ſhould referre himſelf to them as arbitrators, and promiſe to ſubmit to their cenſure, yet
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57278:89"/>
they cannot Eccleſiaſtically excommunicate him, or reſtore him; no more then private men in an arbitration can condemn and execute a malefactor, or abſolve him (though he be innocent) if indited. Many times private men ſtanding by, and hearing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence at the Aſſizes againſt a malefactour, will ſay he is but a dead man, yet that is no judicial condemnation of him, though it be materially according to the law of the land, yet it is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, for ſo is the act of the Judge only, who is in office for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If private Chriſtians bear a double relation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</note> one to the Church Catholike viſible as members thereof, and another to the particular Congregation where they are particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, then ſo do the Miniſters alſo. The univerſality of private Chriſtians memberſhip neceſſarily requires an univerſality of the miniſterial office, for diſpenſing the Ordinances to them, though but occaſionally. As particular members agree with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular members in Chriſtianity, ſo particular Miniſters agree with other particular Miniſters in the miniſterial office. If particular private members can joyn with any Congregations in the Word, Sacraments, and praier, and are bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to them as members of the ſame general body (if there be need) though in forreign countries; then may alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Miniſters diſpenſe the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, if there be neceſſity or occaſion. <hi>Epiphanius Biſhop of Cyprus</hi> ordained a Deacon and Presbyter at <hi>Bethlehem, in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterio Bethlemitico,</hi> in the juriſdiction of <hi>John Biſhop of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> when they were almoſt deſtitute of ſpiritual food, and defended his action thus. <q>Oh Dei timorem hoc facere compulſi ſumus, maximè quum nulla ſit diverſitas in ſacerdotio Dei, &amp; ubi utilitati Eccleſia providetur.

                  <p>Sixthly, There will follow divers great abſurdities, if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Miniſter ſtands only in relation to his own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For then he cannot preach any where as a Miniſter but in his own Congregation, nor yet to any that come to his own Congregation occaſionally, much leſſe adminiſter the ſeals of the Covenant to them, though they come never ſo well appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by teſtimonials, or by their own knowledge of them, which yet hath been the ancient cuſtom of the Church, and is practiſed ſtill among our brethren in <hi>New-England,</hi> by vertue of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Churches, as they ſay: but this being an act of office, cannot be done except there be an habitual, indefinite power of the miniſterial office, which by this deſire of ſtrangers and their teſtimonial, is drawn forth into act.</p>
                  <p>Alſo hereby a Miniſter is rendred but as a private Chriſtian to all the Chriſtian world except his own Congregation, and if his Congregation be any way diſſolved, he is but a private man again. Alſo the cenſore of excommunication which hath
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57278:90"/>
been inflicted by ſuch Officers in ſuch a Congregation can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be taken off by any other Officers in any other Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the diſſolution of that, for no Congregation can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an excommunicated perſon to be a member before abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and abſolve him they cannot, becauſe he is none of their members; <hi>Ejuſdem est ligare &amp; ſolvere:</hi> yea, and if he be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by cenſures in any particular Congregation, no Church in the world can relieve him, except there be an indefinite, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual power of office, which by ſuch occaſions can be drawn forth into act. It maketh way alſo for any private man to preach publikely if he be able, for Miniſters themſelves, by this opinion, ſhould preach but as private men, if they preach out of their own Congregation. Alſo it neceſſarily implyeth that a Miniſter cannot remove from his particular Congregation, though for the great advantage of the Church, unleſſe he will diveſt himſelf of his former Ordination (which was in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence only to his particular Congregation, by this opinion) and take a new Ordination to his Miniſterial office again, as if he had never been ordained before. And all acting in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels muſt be the actings of private Chriſtians. And all the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures that are kept by neighbour-Miniſters in combination, or ſingly (except by the particular Miniſters of that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the Lecture is kept) are performed by private men, for ſo (by this opinion) they are to all the world, except their own Congregations. And ſo if any of their own members come and hear them preach at any ſuch Lectures, Funerals, Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or Baptizings, it is authoritative preaching indeed to them, becauſe of their particular relation to him, but only a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive exerciſing of gifts, as a private man out of office to all men elſe.</p>
                  <p>And if this opinion be true, what ſhall become of all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed viſible Chriſtians in <hi>New-England?</hi> who by reaſon of their unreſolvedneſſe, where yet to fix their civil habitations, or of ſcrupuloſity or want of ability utterance, and boldneſſe, to expreſſe themſelves ſo as to obtain an admiſſion into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation, or haply though viſible Chriſtians under the ſeal of the Covenant, yet have not the inward true work of grace in them, yet are neither ignorant nor ſcandalous, but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57278:91"/>
live inoffenſively, and willing to joyn in and ſubmit unto all Gods Ordinances: I ſay, what ſhall become of them and their ſeed? Shall they all be left without the Church in Satans viſible Kingdom, becauſe they are no particular members, and there is no extenſion of the Miniſterial office beyond the particular Congregations?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is this difference; Every miniſter hath by his Ordination power in <hi>actu primo</hi> to adminiſter the Ordinances of God in all the Churches of the Saints, yet not in <hi>actu ſecundo</hi> without a ſpecial call. But the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts (which were <hi>vicarij Apostolorum</hi>) had both: and the Evangeliſts pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was called forth by the Apoſtles, for they exerciſed their function where the Apoſtles appointed them. The Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their office immediatly from and by Chriſt: The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts theirs from Chriſt by the Apoſtles: ordinary Miniſters theirs from Chriſt indeed, but miniſterially by the Presbytery. The Apoſtles and Evangeliſts were not fixed officers in any particular Congregation, but itinerant from place to place: or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miniſters are fixed in their own Congregations. They ſerved the Church-Catholike actually whereſoever they became, and could draw forth the exerciſe of their offices without any mediate conſent or call of the particular Churches or places, but ſo cannot particular ordinary Miniſters. So that ordinary Miniſters they are Miniſters of the Church Catholike, though not Catholike Miniſters actually. But if Miniſters be Miniſters only in their particular Congregations, where they are fixed, and to which they were called by the Congregation, I marvel that our brethren of the Congregational way here in <hi>England</hi> are ſo deſirous to have itenerant Miniſters to be ſent into all parts of the land that ſhall be faſtned to no particular Congregations: yea, and alſo to have gifted men, not ordained at all, to be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach publikely and conſtantly in Congregations; ſurely theſe things are not conſiſtent with their principles.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> About Combinations of particular Congregations in Claſses, and of them in Synods.</head>
                  <p>A further queſtion is about the combination of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Elderſhips in Claſſes and Synods.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> For though it cannot be denied but that particular Miniſters in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations do ſerve the Church-Catholike in their admiſſions, ejections, and other Ordinances, as preaching to, praying with, and adminiſtring Sacraments to members of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, in their own meeting-houſes, and upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in other meeting houſes, for the caſe is the ſame, whether they come to him, or he go to them; yet it may be doubted whether the Miniſters and Elders may combine together, and jointly exerciſe acts of government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though this doth not neceſſarily belong to my queſtion, yet becauſe it hath ſome reference to the integrality of the Church-Catholike, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of it.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a double Integrality of the Church-Catholike, the firſt is <hi>Entitive</hi> whereby they are all bound together in the viſible embracing, profeſſion of, and ſubjection unto the viſible doctrine, covenant, and laws of Chriſt, whereby they become Chriſtians in the genera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, whereby all Chriſtians are bound as opportunity is offered, to perform Chriſtian duties one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as fellow-members, <hi>ex officio charitatis generali,</hi> not only by vertue of the moral law, but by the law of Chriſt, and to Chriſt as the King and head of his Church. As all dwelling within the kingdom of <hi>England</hi> are members of the Kingdom, and bound to carry themſelves as ſubjects to the governours and laws, and as fellow-ſubjects one to another, though they be fixed members of no Corporations nor Townſhips. And this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grality is alwaies <hi>actual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is as it is organical by combination, as all the Counties and Corporations and Towns by combination make one kingdom: ſo all the particular Chriſtian Congregations,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57278:92"/>
Provinces and Kingdoms by combination make one Church-Catholike viſible under Chriſt,<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> and this is an habitual integra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Of this it is that <hi>Ames</hi> ſpeaks, the Church-Catholike in regard of the external ſtate thereof, <hi>Per combinationem habet ſuam integralitutem,</hi> Am. med. l. 1. c. 33. f. 18.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe a double combination, one habitual, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all Churches and Chriſtians are united and habitually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined into one political Kingdom under Chriſt, and are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be mutually helpful one to another, as need requires, as becometh fellow-ſubjects and fellow-members: ſecondly, there is actual combination, whereby any particular Churches ſhall actually agree, and ſo unite together for mutual help of each other, and for tranſactions of buſineſſes of common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this is either a conſtant combination of vicinities in a Claſſis, becauſe there will be conſtant cauſe; or occaſional and more ſeldome, as of a whole Province or Nation, and may be of the whole Church-Catholike, if convenible by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates. This latter combination is <hi>fundamentum exercitij:</hi> by the former they have <hi>jus adrem,</hi> by this latter they have <hi>jus in re,</hi> to act <hi>conjunctim</hi> for the good of thoſe Churches ſo actually combined.</p>
                  <p>And of this ſecond kinde of integrality and combination it is that we are now ſpeaking, which neceſſarily ariſeth from the former, as the organical integrality of a Kingdom ariſeth from the Entitive. For ſeeing all are fellow-ſubjects under the ſame Soveraign and Laws, though they have particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Corporations and Towns wherein they live, and actually enjoy conſtantly the general priviledges of ſubjects under the King and Laws, yet there will neceſſarily reſult a community and habitual integrality of the whole by coordinate combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The civil and Eccleſiaſtical combinations as they proceed from a parallel ground, <hi>viz.</hi> ſubjection to the ſame laws and Soveraign (I mean reſpectively) ſo they muſt neceſſarily run parallel in things that are general and eſſential to combination. Our brethren make them run parallel in the two firſt ſteps, <hi>viz.</hi> in combining particular perſons into families, and particular families into Congregations of them that are <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57278:92"/>
together in ſome vicinity, which is nothing elſe in Engliſh but Pariſhioners, the Engliſh word comes of the greek. The Chriſtians dwelling together made one Church at <hi>Jeruſalem, Epheſus, Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. by Eccleſiaſtical combination, as well as one city by civil combination reſpectively. And I doubt not but if all the Inhabitants of any one Town in <hi>New-England</hi> were judged fit to be members of the Church, they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine them as members of the Church in that Town, and that Town would give denomination to them all as the Church in or of ſuch a Town. And ſeeing the ſubjects of Chriſts Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Kingdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>unne parallel further with the ſubjects of a civil Kingdom, they all being Chriſtians, Why may not the combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo run parallel, and the denomination be parallel for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of common Eccleſiaſtical affairs, as well as civil, if pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo dictate it? and the Churches in a hundred if they lie convenient, combine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>to a Claſſis as well, as into a hundred for civil tranſaction? And the Claſſes into a Province as well as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds into a County or Shire? and the Provinces into a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church as well as the Counties into a civil Kingdom? and ſeeing Chriſts Eccleſiaſtical Kingdom reacheth over many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, why may they not make one habitual Church-Catholike, as well as many Kingdoms under the ſame laws and head make one Empire? The actuality indeed may ceaſe where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant or frequent community of acting ceaſeth, whether at the Congregation or Claſſis where all the Officers are combined in frequent common acting, or at the National Church where the civil community ceaſeth, and ſo the frequent occaſion of common acting by delegates ceaſe, I determine not, but the habituality ceaſeth not in the whole Church-Catholike vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall firſt ſpeak of the combination of particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations into a Presbyterial Church,<note place="margin">

That there may be a college or body of Elders that can act <hi>conjunction</hi> as well as <hi>diviſim,</hi> appears from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. where the Presbytery are ſaid to lay their hands on <hi>Timothy.</hi> There is the name and thing, and their acting <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim</hi> in Ordination, which was not the Presbytery of a ſingle Church, or at leaſt not ſo conſidered in their Ordination of an
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57278:93"/>
Evangeliſt, an itinerant, univerſal, actual officer under the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Our brethren alſo in <hi>New-England</hi> joyn the Elders of divers Congregations together in ordaining Elders for a new-erected Congregation, and not only the erecting of new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations will require it neceſſarily, but the ſupplying of other Congregations vacant by death, for there are but few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations ſo well ſtored with preaching Presbyters, as can ordain new ones, if one or two of them die. Alſo we finde an Elderſhip acting together, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.6. <hi>The Apoſtles and Elders came together to conſider of this matter.</hi> Alſo <hi>Act.</hi> 11.30. and <hi>Act.</hi> 21.18. Chriſt gave the keys to the Apoſtles together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye and teach and baptize,</hi> &amp;c. who though they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their extraordinary calling of Apoſtleſhip for themſelves only, yet they received the miniſterial office for all ſucceeding Miniſters, and we finde no other eſpecial donation of the keys; and this appears by the following words, <hi>Lo I am with you alway even to the end of the world;</hi> which muſt needs be meant of the ſucceeding Miniſters, for the Apoſtles were not to laſt to the end of the world, neither their perſons nor their office. Therefore as the Apoſtles could from that donation exerciſe the keys <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim &amp; diviſim</hi> in their extraordinary function, ſo may the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters exerciſe theirs alſo, and ſome keys cannot be uſed but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim,</hi> as in Ordination and diſpenſing cenſures: and if El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſeveral Congregations can act together as Elders in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination (even in <hi>New-England</hi>) and in cenſures, much more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> in a greater body. And if our brethren in <hi>New-England</hi> dared admit private men to lay on their hands in ordination of their Miniſters, doubtleſſe they would appoint ſome of their own private members to do it, that ſo (according to their tenet) they might enjoy all Gods Ordinances independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their particular Congregations, and not admit of a forreign Officer to come and act as an Officer among them.</p>
                  <p>That divers Congregations may combine and make one Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Church, appears by divers inſtances in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Now that there were ſeveral Congregations in each of theſe cities appears, becauſe there were in each of them ſo great a multitude of beleevers, as that they could not meet together to partake of all Gods Ordinances, eſpecially if we conſider that they had no publike eminent buildings for meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes, but met privately <gap reason="foreign">

And this manner of meeting continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the times of perſecution in that age, and ſome ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it appears by the multitude of Church-Officers, Elders, Prophets and Teachers that were in each of them, which could not buſie themſelves in one Congregation, and ſure they were not idle in thoſe daies.

                  <p>And if theſe Churches were ſuch (as in all rational probability they were) then that poſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there are no other Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical ſocieties inſtituted by Chriſt but particular Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Churches, will not hold good; and the Baſis of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way will fail, and the partition wall that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereby to be between them and the Presbyterians, muſt fall down.</p>
                  <p>And this unity of theſe Churches was not a ſpiritual unity in regard of ſaving grace, for all the members had not that; nor in regard of judgement, belief, heart and way, for that was common to all the Chriſtian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

were diſperſed in their ſeveral Congregations, and could not be jointly together in regard of their multitudes. Neither were they one in reference to the Apoſtles general power and office only, they being univerſal Paſtors; for ſo the univerſal Church over the whole world was one; but in regard of the common Presbytery whereby they were governed conſtantly, and the Apoſtles themſelves being in theſe ſeveral Churches did act as co-Presbyters with their Elders, and ſo they call themſelves Elders, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though indeed it cannot be peremptorily affirmed, that theſe Presbyterial Churches had their ſeveral Elders fixed to their ſeveral Congregations; yet that (as I conceive) varies not the queſtion at all. And yet it is very probable that the Elders in thoſe cities did divide thoſe cities between them, for particular teaching and inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of manners, to avoid confuſion, and for a better means of converſion and edification of the whole, that ſo the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and others might the better know where they ſhould be baptized, taught and inſtructed (ſo far I mean as the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There may alſo fall out a difference between the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and their particular Presbytery, and then who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide it? yea, the very Presbytery in a Congregation may differ, and be equally divided among themſelves, and who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide that difference? There may be ſome great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one Congregation and another Congregation, and they being equal in authority as Congregations are, <hi>Par in Parem non babet imperium,</hi> who then ſhall end theſe differences, if both be reſolute, and will not yeeld each to other, or to the advice, counſel and perſwaſion of neighbour-Churches? Therefore it is neceſſary that there be an authoritative conjoyned Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, wherein the whole hath power to regulate the parts; the greater part of the body to heal and help the leſſe, either in keeping them from diviſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to cure them of diviſions, when they are riſen.</p>
                  <p>Sometime again many neighbour Congregations are ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized by ſome notorious evil breaking out in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or their members endangered by the evil example of ſome perſons dwelling in one of the neighbour Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and having recourſe unto, and converſe with the members of the reſt, and haply that Congregation cannot, will not, or do not cenſure that offendour: ſhall there be no means to bring him to cenſure, and afford a remedy for the reſt? Some heretick may endanger the members of divers Congregations, and yet live but in one, and that one not able (haply) to grapple with him; or haply he be a fixed member of none (as may eaſily fall out, eſpecially if Churches conſiſted only of gathered mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as ſome would have them) or one that ſhifteth up and down to avoid Congregational cenſure, how ſhall he be dealt withal, without combination of Churches?</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the offendour or ſcandalous perſon is a member of one Congregation, and the witneſſes live in two or three neighbour Congregations, how ſhall this mans cauſe be brought

to trial? The Elders of that Congregation where the accuſed perſon dwelleth cannot authoritatively ſend for witneſſes out of another, and if they will come voluntarily, they cannot (by our laws) ſafely adminiſter an oath unto them: neither can the Elders where the witneſſes dwell ſend for the accuſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon authoritatively, nor cenſure him if he will come volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.

                  <p>The nature of <hi>Synods</hi> is all one, whether they be Provincial, National or Oecumenical, and they only differ as greater or leſſe, but their power in reference to their precincts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation is alike. They differ from Presbyteries called Claſſes, becauſe the <hi>Provincial</hi> is conſtituted only of certain delegated
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57278:95"/>
members from the claſſical Presbyteries of the ſame Province: the <hi>National</hi> of delegated members from the Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods: and the Oecumenical of delegated members from the National Synods: whereas the <hi>Claſſis</hi> is conſtituted of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the particular Congregations combined together. The <hi>Claſſes</hi> are more frequent, conſtant, and ordinary in their meetings, the other more rare and extraordinary. The power of <hi>Synods</hi> is not at all civil, but Eccleſiaſtical, neither is it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the power of Claſſes, or ſingle Congregations, but perfective and conſervative. They are not infallible, but may erre as well as a Claſſis, or ſingle Elderſhip, yet are not ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereto, becauſe in the multitude of Counſellours there is ſafety, and they conſiſt of more choice able men, and not ſo liable to perſonal prejudice againſt the accuſed, nor likely to be ſwayed by fear, or favour, or ſiniſter reſpects. Their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not meerly conſultatory and ſuaſive, but authoritative, and to be ſubmitted unto by thoſe for whom their delegation is, ſo farre as their acts are according to the word of God, <hi>In Synodo eſt authoritatis apex, totius Eccleſiae unitas, ordinis firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> Leid. profeſ. de concil. If it be no more but conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and ſuaſive, that is no more then a few private men may do, yea, one man or woman may counſel, adviſe and perſwade. By M. <hi>Ellis</hi>'s opinion Councels and Synods being void of all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority are but as a company of private Chriſtians met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to adviſe one with another how to act in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, where only (ſaith he) they are in office: it may be an act of thoſe that are in office but not as Officers, ſo that in that act they are to be conſidered as private members, who by ſuch conſultation take or give private advice how to act as offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, where they are Officers. Which is no otherwiſe then if in theſe times of trouble and danger, a company of peti-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables ſhould meet occaſionally, or by appointment together at a market-town, and there conſult together how to act moſt commodiouſly and uniformly in their ſeveral Pariſhes, in the preſſing of Souldiers, or gathering Aſſeſſements: or a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Mayors of ſeveral Corparations ſhould meet by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>London,</hi> and there adviſe together, how to order their ſeveral Corporations. So that a <hi>Synod</hi> whether <hi>Provincial,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57278:96"/>
National,</hi> or <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> can have no power to ſummon any heretick or ſcandalous perſon, and if any ſuch ſhould volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily come before them, or be brought before them by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate, that ſhould before their faces blaſpheme the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> or be convicted of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> yea, though any of their own members ſhould curſe God himſelf, or be convicted of a preſent act of <hi>whoredom,</hi> or of <hi>ſorcery,</hi> they have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to cenſure him Eccleſiaſtically, but fraternally admoniſh him, and ſend him back to his own Congregation to be cenſured, and they themſelves only go thither as witneſſes againſt him, becauſe they are there (by this opinion) out of office, and all cenſures belong to the particular Elderſhips, as particular. But ſuppoſe now this heretick or ſcandalous perſon being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted (haply) from the Congregation where formerly he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or that Congregation being diſſolved be a fixed member of no Congregation (as ten thouſands of viſible Chriſtians, <hi>i. e.</hi> that have received the doctrine of Chriſt, and are under the ſeal of Baptiſm, may be, if particular Churches conſiſt only of ſuch as can give evidence of the work of true grace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) ſhall he remain an entitive member of Chriſts viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a gangreened limb, a rebel and traitour under the name and notion of a ſubject, and infect the reſt of the body, and there be no remedy?</p>

                  <p>The occaſion of that <hi>Synod</hi> was an errour broached at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and neighbour-Churches, to enforce the obſervation of the ceremonial Law by all Chriſtians, and this was promoted by lying, as if they were ſent by the Apoſtles and Elders at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to preach this doctrine. Hereby the Churches were much troubled, and in danger to be ſubverted in their ſouls, This could not be ſuppreſſed by the diſputes of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and

But if there were delegates but from two Churches, it will juſtifie delegates from ten or twenty.</p>
                  <p>And as the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> did not ſend <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> as extraordinary and infallible and authentical Oracles of God, as M. <hi>Cotton</hi> noteth, for then what need the advice and help of Elders that were below them, being but ordinary and particular Officers of <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> But as wiſe and holy guides of the Church, who might not only relieve them by ſome wiſe counſel and holy order, but alſo ſet a precedent to ſucceeding ages, how errours and diſſentions in Churches might be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and healed. And with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> they joyned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>meſſengers</hi> in the ſame commiſſion. So when this <hi>Synod</hi> was met, the Apoſtles acted not by their Apoſtolical, infallible, tranſcendent power, or by immediate inſpiration, as in the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Scripture; but the matters were carried on in an ordinary Synodal way by diſputes and diſcourſes, they delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated about the true ſtate of the queſtion, and the remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and after deliberation and diſputes, they deciſively conclude and determine the matter, and put forth all the three fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med power.

                  <p>And as the unity of the whole viſible Church and political Kingdom of Chriſt requires this, as the <hi>London-Miniſters</hi> have well noted, wherein all things are to be managed as between members and fellow-ſubjects, and the greater part in coordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to rule the leſſe in the Lord, and the whole the parts: ſo alſo there is the ſame neceſſity of <hi>Synods</hi> as of Claſſical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, and otherwiſe there will be irremediable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>Alſo we may obſerve the like ſubordination and appeals in the Jewiſh Church: the ſeveral Synagogues were ſubordinate to the great Aſſembly at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and had their appeals thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in greater cauſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8, 12. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8, 11. <hi>Exo.</hi> 18.22, 26. And this could not be a ceremonial Law, for it did ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie nothing. The appeals were not to the high Prieſt, typify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, but to their higheſt Court: and though it were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to them, yet the equity of it remains, and ſo far as it was grounded on common right it is moral. Now the like diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers that occaſioned that Law then, remain ſtill as great among us, and ever will. And it is obſervable that this thing was not learned by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the pattern ſhewed him in the Mount, but was taught by the light of nature to <hi>Iethro,</hi> and by him was given in advice to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exo. 18.22. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward was approved by God, as being according to right reaſon, and a thing common to all ſocieties as ſocieties, not Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical only, and not a poſitive law only, but dictated by the light of nature, right reaſon and neceſſity, and therefore is practiſed in all ages, nations, armies and ſocieties, though not in every particular circumſtance. And therefore except it were forbidden, or ſome other way inſtituted to avoid thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and dangers that will ariſe, it ought to be in uſe alſo in the Church under the Goſpel, as well as ſummoning, convening in fitting times and places, and a moderatour or chair-man, and ſilence, obedience and reſpect, and due order in proceedings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to allegation and probation, which are things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

And they did ſerve the whole as one actually when they were convenible, but their number encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they divided into ſeveral companies, for their better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, edification and encreaſe: and therefore the inſtance is not parallel, for the office of the Miniſters is firſt to the whole, and the Charter and Statutes of the whole and of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church are but one: and therefore the Miniſters though they ordinarily act in their particular Congregations, as it were in their particular Colleges, being called by them to take the immediate, conſtant, particular inſpection of them, yet can they exerciſe their general office when and whereſoever they have a call thereunto.

                     <q>By this means (ſaith he) the power being given not to any one Church, but to the whole Church as one body, and not to the members with the Officers, but to the Officers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is derived a very tranſcendent power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon every particular Miniſter, more then any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment man hath, yea, more then a King, who is limited to his dominion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I anſwer, that the Presbyterians acknowledge that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of government is given immediatly to every Congregational Elderſhip, or at leaſt to ſuch a College of Elders as may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and conſtantly meet and rule in common, as they did at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and it is not derived unto them by any ſuperiour authority on earth, by way of deſcention, except by a Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial inveſtment by Ordination. And this power is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly exerted for the actual, Eccleſiaſtical regiment of that Congregation, or thoſe Congregations over whom thoſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are ſet in the Lord, yet with reference to the reſt of the body, whereof they are but a parcel, and they may ſtand in need of the help of more Elders then their own, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>It is true, government is not given to the members with the Officers, but to the Officers only: not to the body of the Congregation as the ſubject of it; either in whole or in part, as they are private members diſtinct from the Officers, much leſſe are they the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And for the inference hence of ſuch a tranſcendent power and authority upon every particular Miniſter more then a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament man or a King. I ſuppoſe M. <hi>Ellis</hi> is not ignorant that the office of every particular Miniſter in his Congregation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him authority to do more in adminiſtring Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (as authoritative preaching, and adminiſtring the ſeals of the Covenant, and the Officers in adminiſtring ſpiritual cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures) then a Parliament man or a King can do. Remember <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziahs</hi> example. And yet in all civil affairs they are as duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubjects as any elſe, and as much ſubject to civil authority. Becauſe the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> were in the matters of God

The office and power and honour that belong thereto is of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kinde, then Parliaments and Kings, it is not civil but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. You know Gods Miniſters have power to <hi>baptize Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament men, Nobles</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> and their children, and to give them the Lords Supper, and to teach, admoniſh, reprove, and from God to threaten and denounce judgements againſt them, even eternal deſtruction, if they go on in ſinful courſes. They do doctrinally binde and looſe <hi>Princes,</hi> and their whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and the whole world, as occaſion ſerveth. And can any man ſay that the greateſt men are by their greatneſſe free from Church-cenſures, if they be notoriouſly vile? and yet none can impoſe them but Eccleſiaſtical Officers. Suppoſe divers Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament men or Noble men, yea, a King himſelf were members of a Congregational Independent Church, would not the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of that Congregation account it their duty to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter all Gods Ordinances to them, as occaſion requires, yea, the Ordinances of diſcipline and cenſures, if there be juſt cauſe?</p>
                  <p>Sir, would you now be willing to have a retortion of your own kinde? with a <hi>Let it be obſerved by all ſorts,</hi> that by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent way power is given to 2. or 3.

                  <p>
                     <q>It makes (ſaith M. <hi>Ellis</hi>) every Miniſter one of the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers of the Chriſtian world, to whom with his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues (not ſeverally and by diſtribution, but jointly and as one body) is committed the government of the whole Chriſtian world, and managing the affairs of the ſon of God throughout

the face of the earth.</q> And this is marked with (") as if theſe were the very words of the Presbyterians, which are but his own paraphraſe and collection, and not their ſenſe, much leſſe their words.</p>
                  <p>But I anſwer, Every Miniſters office is habitually indefinite, but he is not actually a ſtanding Officer of the Chriſtian world. But as a <hi>Phyſician</hi> by this calling profeſſion and licenſe, is a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> to the whole world habitually, and may act upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and about the lives of men, of what nation ſoever, where and when he hath a call. And as a <hi>Lawyer</hi> is a <hi>Lawyer</hi> to the whole Kingdom, and hath power by his call to the bar to deal about any mans caſe or eſtate (ſo far as the Law alloweth, and his calling ſerveth) where and when he is required, and yet theſe are but profeſſions, not offices, which would make the habitual power haply more reducible into act, upon a lawful cal: but Chriſts Miniſters have an indefinite habitual office, beyond their particular Congregations, yet in regard of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſtant exerciſe thereof, it is diſtributively over their own flocks, which are as their conſtant Patients and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, but if there be neceſſity, juſt occaſion, and a call to be helpful to any others joyntly with them that have the ſame office, they may exerciſe their power in any part of the whole body.</p>

                  <p>But he confeſſeth every particular Miniſter in his place to be Chriſts Vicar (as he terms him) <hi>i. e.</hi> to act <hi>vice Chriſti,</hi> and

all diſtributively to be Chriſts Vicars general. I ſee he is not ſublimated ſo high (as ſome are) as to make the Miniſters to be the Vicars or Stewards of the Congregation, and to carry their keys for them. But can they act <hi>vice Chriſti</hi> no where elſe? in whoſe name doe they preach, baptize, adminiſter the Lords Supper, and bleſſe the people, when they act abroad occaſionally? This ariſeth from that principle (diſclaimed in all former ages of the Church) that a Miniſter is a Miniſter, but in his own Congregation, and out of office to all the Church beſides.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is there not the ſame reaſon that the whole world ſhould have a hand in the choice of every Phyſician? and the whole Kingdom of every Lawyer? And by the ſame reaſon it will follow, that the whole Chriſtian world ſhould have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the admitting of every member of the Church, ſeeing they be members not of the particular Congregation only, into which by particular aſſociation they are admitted, but of the whole Church-Catholike viſible. But as every Miniſter is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the admitting of members into the whole, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Elderſhip with caſting out of the whole: ſo may every conjoyned Presbytery be alſo with the admittance of an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. It is impoſſible that the whole Church ſhould meet about admittance either of members or Officers, but the particular parts are entruſted in the places where they live: and if any man or woman can give in any juſt exception againſt either member or Miniſter, that is to be admitted, it ſhall debar their admiſſion, or procure an ejection.</p>
                  <p>The new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Rev. 21. it ſaid to have 12. gates, and there was an admiſſion into the whole city by every gate: ſo is there admiſſion into the whole Church by baptiſm in every Congregation.

Neither is a Miniſter bound alwaies to put forth the exerciſe of every key, where he puts forth one. A man may preach where he adminiſtreth no Sacraments. <hi>Paul</hi> preached much at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but was not bound to baptize there: though no doubt he converted many, yet he baptized but few, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.

                  <p>A man may adminiſter Sacraments where he preacheth not, as the Apoſtles baptized, but Chriſt only preached there. And he that baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, did not preach unto them, but <hi>Peter</hi> only preached. We reade not that the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Alſo a Miniſter may rule where he neither preacheth nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtreth any Sacraments: for all the Elders in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ruled in common; but preached and admniſtred Sacraments from houſe to houſe, and could not preach to every Congregation whom they ruled.

Secondly, They chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged that to be due to one that belonged to a College or Elderſhip, or combination of Elders. Thirdly, They rob'd the people and Poſtors of their liberty and power: for they did not aſſociate Congregations with them, but ſubdued them unto them. They were not mutually ſubject to Presbyteries, but made the Presbyteries ſubject to themſelves. They did not carry things in way of conſociation and confederacy as <hi>inter Pares,</hi> but as Lords both of Miniſters and people. They took the whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſe to be their actual cure, and all Miniſters were but their Curates. They forced men to bring in preſentments to them and their delegates, which concerned the particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations only, and ought and might have been tranſacted there. But it was not for exerciſing an act of diſcipline meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where they did not preach, but becauſe it was not on a right ground, nor in a right way.

Their tenet (as far as I can collect from their books) is, that a company of viſible beleevers being joyned together in a particular holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, have thereby right to the enjoyment of all Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and hence flow their right of chooſing and ordaining Officers over themſelves (the Ordination in their ſenſe being nothing elſe (as I conceive) but a deſignation or aſſignation of thoſe choſen men) by the impoſition of hands (of ſome men appointed by them in their name and behalf) to be their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Officers, to diſpenſe the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt unto them. And hence alſo floweth their right of cenſuring and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting thoſe Officers again, if they miſcarry themſelves. <hi>Ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem eſt inſtituere &amp; destituere,</hi> and if the Congregation can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point men to lay hands on their Officers in their behalf, and ſet them up, then alſo if they ſee cauſe they can appoint men to lay hands on them by cenſures, and pluck them down again, or elſe they muſt go out of their Congregation to neighbour Elders for that cenſure, which is contrary to their own tenet, if it be an Ordinance of God. Yea, they muſt go out of their Congregation for diſcipline, which is moſt contrary to their principles, and that indeed where the greateſt pinch lyeth, for they do not ſo much ſtartle at a Miniſters diſpenſing the word or Sacraments to other Congregations, for that is done fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by them, or at the exerciſe of the key of diſcipline, and as I conceive, that it is that which breedeth this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. And if they muſt go out of their Congregation for the cenſure of their Elders, why not by the ſame reaſon in ſome caſes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57278:107"/>
for the cenſure of ſome private members? So that by their tenet their right to Gods Ordinances neither ariſeth from their being in the general Covenant, for ſo they were before their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor yet from their organicalneſs, for they have power to organize themſelves, and diſannul thoſe Organs again, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſome Church-acts before and without Organs, but it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth meerly from their particular covenant and conſederation.</p>

                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:57278:108"/>Here he granteth almoſt as much as the Presbyterians doe deſire, yet plucks it away again in the very next words in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <q>That their acting in giving ſuch directions and rules, is the acting of Officers, but not as Officers, for ſuch they are only in their ſeveral Churches, but yet by reaſon of that relation they are the more fit for that work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> But hereby he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthroweth the analogy of their acting with the acting of an aſſembly of Lawyers or Judges, or a College of Phyſitians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened by publike conſent, which he there makes the parallel of this Eccleſiaſtical acting, for their acting <hi>conjunctim</hi> is by vertue of their office and profeſſions reſpectively, as much as <hi>diviſim,</hi> and not meerly as friends or men skilled in thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and ſciences; for it (by their office and profeſſion) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh (as he confeſſeth) authoritative, and to be ſubmitted unto, not only becauſe materially good but formally theirs, who by office and profeſſion have power and authority to give it. If he would have made his parallel to run to his minde, he ſhould have reſembled the actings in Councels to the advice of underſtanding friends and neighbours in matters of Law and Phyſick, who have no office therein, or profeſſion thereof, but have ſome knowledge and experience therein, and thereby are fit to give friendly and neighbourly, charitative advice and directions. How men can have authority to make rules which are to be obeyed becauſe they are formally their rules, and yet do this as men without office, I underſtand not. The Synod <hi>Act.</hi> 15. did make decrees and give commands, he confeſſeth, but did not impoſe any penalty: but ſurely the making decrees and commands implyed an authority, and that <hi>conjunctim</hi> ſo to do, and the impoſing of them implyed a power of office, and that a coercive alſo, elſe decrees and commands are to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And to paſſe by his ſecond grant, what power the Church-Catholike may poſſibly have in unuſual and extraordinary caſes or accidents, I come to his third gram, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>what power the univerſal viſible Church might have (if poſſibly convenable) together, as it was at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (in which caſe (ſaith he) we grant what is co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here he granteth what is contended for, if the whole were convenable, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as I conceive) all the Officers of the whole Church. But if that could be, I doubt he holds they muſt, either act as men out of office, or an particular Officers, every one in reference to his particular Congregation: or can their conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion together put a general office upon them which they had not before? or draw forth general actions that concern the whole, from them that had no habitual power reaching the whole? but if all the Officers met together can rule the whole, becauſe every particular Congregation hath its Officer there, why hath not a part thereof convened, power to rule that part alſo? ſeeing the right and reaſon is the ſame, ſeeing the Church is a ſimilar body in regard of the integrals, and the parts are ſimilar parts. And if ſo, here will be an unavoidable ground for claſſical aſſociations, where all the Officers may meet. <q>And himſelf freely acknowledgeth the conveniency and neceſſity of Claſſes, yea, and Synods alſo, for direction and determination, and that by divine right, though not with power properly juridical. <hi>vind.</hi> pag. 3.

                  </p>
                  <p>But the reaſon why his parallel of a Kingdom, where a part cannot make laws for that part, holdeth not, is becauſe the whole Kingdom is under one legiſlative power, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together in a body repreſentative under one head, who have power to make uniform laws for the whole, but neither the Church-Catholike nor any particular Church can make any new divine laws, or abrogate any of them which Chriſt hath ſet down, but explain them, and make particular rules according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and not otherwiſe: and put Chriſts laws in execution: and this a particular combination may do in their ſphear, for their limits. And ſo as farre as their Commiſſions reach, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers

in a Corporation may make conſtitutions for the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo they be not contrary to their charter; and the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Committees for a County may make Orders for the County, ſo they be agreeable to the Laws of the Land, whereof the County is a part: and have habitual power to execute juſtice in any part of the County, as occaſion ſerveth, though they, for conveniency ſake, do uſually act in their ſeveral divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

                  <p>Beſides, this ſtating of the queſtion is not conſiſtent with it ſelf, for it makes the Church-Catholike the firſt ſubject of all Church-power, and then makes the Miniſters and Elders the proper ſubject thereof: but the proper ſubject is the prime ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Unleſſe he means in a logical ſenſe, as ſight is predicated of the whole man, and yet is ſeated properly in the eye: or reaſon is given to the whole man, and yet is ſeated in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.

                  <p>Yet do not the Presbyterians hold, that the particular Churches or Officers act by authority of, and commiſſion from the one entire, ſingle Common-wealth, Corporation and Congregation of the whole company of Chriſtians on earth, as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> is pleaſed to ſet it down, to render their tenets odious: but they hold that every Miniſter by vertue of his office hath an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate habitual power from Chriſt to diſpenſe his Ordinances, but the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of more general errours and ſcandals, the propagating of the Goſpel, and the good of others as God gives opportunity, it may be exerted and exerciſed in other places, and to other perſons, ſo confuſion and diſorder be avoided.</p>
                  <p>Neither do the National Churches act by commiſſion from the Catholike, nor the Provincial from the National, nor the Claſſis from the Provincial, nor the Congregational from the Claſſis; but every Miniſter acts by commiſſion from Jeſus Chriſt, by vertue of his Office. And the Congregational Elderſhip is firſt in acting, though laſt in Chriſts intention, in inſtituting the office. Every drop of water is ſimilar to the whole element, and is cold and moiſt, but receive not thoſe qualities from the whole Element, but hath them immediatly in its ſelf, and though it actually exerts them only where it is placed and applied, yet hath an habitual power to exert them any where elſe, if appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So the Church-Officers have their powder, neither from the Church Catholike nor from their particular Congregation, but from their office, which they receive from Chriſt (though miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially admitted thereto by the Presbytery) which power though ordinarily and conſtantly they exert in their own Congregation, yet can elſewhere upon a call.</p>
                  <p>Neither do the Presbyterians ſay, that the Church-Catholike or the whole campary of Chriſtians on earth, are in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſetled Church-conſtitution one entire, ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, Corporation and Congregation actually, but one habitual Common-wealth and Corporation, made up by the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of all the ſingle, actual Congregations of Chriſtians in the world (as an Empire of all the Provinces and Kingdoms under it) and that beſide the particular, actual, conſtant affairs of the Congregations, which are properly to be managed by ſuch as are the particular actual Officers thereof, there are ſome things that concern more then themſelves, and thoſe are to be tranſacted (as ſuch occaſions ariſe) by the Officers of ſo many Congregations as they concern, they belonging properly to the cognizance of Officers, as Officers: and if thoſe matters be of more general concernment, then that all the Officers concerned therein can meet, without confuſion, to tranſact them, then they are to delegate ſome choice Officers from the

ſeveral vicinities to tranſact them, as hath been ſhewed before: and as the call of the Congregation draweth forth the power of the Officers to act among them conſtantly, ſo this delegation cals forth their power to act occaſionally <hi>pro tempore</hi> in this greater meeting.

                     </gap>ut of very few, <hi>viz.</hi> the Elders of <hi>Aruheim,</hi> as I have been enformed) therefore it is conceived that there ſhould be a certain time and place appointed for the Elders of ſuch a vicinity as are in combination for mutual aſſiſtance, to meet in.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Ellis</hi> miſtakes the ſtate of the queſtion, in ſaying the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters <q>and Elders of the Catholike Church not taken ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally but jointly, as one entire College or Presbytery, have the charge ſeverally and jointly of the whole, and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church committed to them, <hi>vind.</hi> pag. 9.</q> For they are not actually Miniſters and Elders of the Church-Catholike,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57278:111"/>
nor actually one entire College and Presbytery, nor have not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually the charge of the whole and every particular Church, but habitually only, by reaſon of the indefiniteneſſe of their office. They have power <hi>in actu primo</hi> by vertue of their office, but not <hi>in actu ſecundo ſive exercito:</hi> they have <hi>jus ad rem</hi> every where, but not <hi>in re</hi> any where without a call. They are the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and thereby have right and power to perform the acts belonging to their office, but for the execution of it, either in a particular Church conſtantly, or <hi>conjunctim</hi> occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally with others, there is required a call thereunto. And the not obſerving of this diſtinction is the cauſe of this difference in this queſtion. The Levites were by their office conſecrated to <hi>do the ſervice of the Tabernacle, and to ſtand before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to miniſter unto them,</hi> Numb. 16.9. And the Prieſts to offer ſacrifice: and both Prieſts and Levites were to be Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Judges and Iſrael: and they had 48. Cities with their ſuburbs given unto them: but they might not at their pleaſure exerciſe this power, and dwell where they liſted, and miniſter in what they pleaſed, or offer ſacrifice promiſcuouſly when they liſted, or be Teachers and Judges where and when they liſted, but according to appointment and aſſignation, and according to their courſes, and as they had a call to exert their power. So it is with the Miniſters of the Goſpel, They are veſted with an office to diſpenſe Gods Ordinances of worſhip and diſcipline, but they may not execute this office, but as they have an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial call thereunto, no more then require maintenance, which alſo belongs to their office, except from thoſe that call them to exerciſe their office among them. There are houſes and gleabs and maintenance allotted by the law of the land for the Miniſtry, but every Miniſter may not carve for himſelf where and what he pleaſeth. The particular exerting of the office and reception of maintenance in and from particular Congregations is not <hi>quà</hi> Miniſter indefinitely and habitually, but <hi>quà Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Alexandrinus, Londinenſis, Gippovicenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that the Church is one habitually, and that the particular Churches bear the relation of members to the whole, and of fellow members one to another, and that Miniſters are Miniſters beyond the limits of their particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and can upon occaſion adminiſter the Ordinances of God to more perſons then thoſe of their own Congregation au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively (upon which hinge hangeth the whole queſtion) this is no novel opinion.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt execution of the Evangelical, Miniſterial office, in teaching and baptizing by John Baptiſt, and by the Apoſtles before they had their general commiſſion, and the preaching of the 70. was without any reſpect to any particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, for there were none ſet up. And when they were ſet up, the Apoſtles ſend faithful teachers to the ſeveral Churches whom they commended alſo to them, exhorting them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, reſpect, and obey them; as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.10, 11, 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.19, 23. And the many places whether <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> travelled, and where they preached and exerciſed their office, is abundantly ſet down in the Scriptures, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out by <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle alſo ſent <hi>Tychicus</hi> a faithful Miniſter to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,</hi> Eph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.21. and under the ſame notion of a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter he ſends him alſo to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Col. 7.8. as is further noted in the ſecond queſtion. And leſt this ſhould be ſaid to he done as he was an Evangeliſt (though we finde him not expreſly called an Evangeliſt) yet it is clear that there were many that preached the Goſpel in the Apoſtles daies in more places then one authoritatively. The brethren that <hi>John</hi> writes of in his 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Epiſt. ment forth and were helpers to the truth, taking nothing of the Gentile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57278:112"/>
have taken maintenance, but did not, that they might ſpread the Goſpel. It appears alſo even by the falſe Teachers that crept into <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> abſence: and thoſe that went from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Antinch</hi> and bred the broil there, and thoſe that preached the Goſpel of envy and ſtrife, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>5. who certainly were no Evangeliſts, neither do I allow of their falſe doctrine, yet it proveth that it was ordinary for Miniſters to preach to more Congregations then one. And it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that thoſe diſperſed which went up and down preaching, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.4. were officers, as one hath lately ſhewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what ſhould the Apoſtles doe at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> if there were no private Chriſtians there? and it is likely that the heat of the perſecution fell moſt upon the officers, and therefore they were generally ſcattered abroad, except the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>And in the after ages of the Church there was nothing more frequent, then for Miniſters to act out of their own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. We finde indeed proviſion made by <hi>Canons</hi> for the ordering of Miniſters in the exerciſe of their function in other places then their own, but no prohibition to exclude them from it.

And this will neceſſarily require that they ſhould be furniſhed with authority to tranſact thoſe affairs of common concernment, and that is as much as the Presbyterians contend for in the behalf of Synods. <q>No State (ſaith he) can take my wife from me, or diſpoſe of my children in marriage: this is of peculiar right: ſo in Churches.</q>

                  <p>And though a maſter of a family ought not to yield up his family-government over wife, children and ſervants, to rule them in common with other Maſters of families, as M. <hi>A.</hi> and M. <hi>S.</hi> note in their <hi>Def.</hi> p. 110. yet if he abuſe his government over them, the wronged perſons either wife, children or ſervants, may be relieved by the Magiſtrate, who yet hath no conſtant actual hand in the family-government.</p>

                  <p>To the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a neceſſity of univerſal and general Officers, and ſome one above the reſt, to whom the particular Churches may have continual recourſe, hath been anſwered before, <hi>Cha.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</p>

And yet we ſee that Parliaments, and Diets civil, are not ſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Courts, no more need Councels Eccleſiaſtical be. And whereas he ſaith it were notably vain to imagine that Chriſt hath committed the government of his Church firſt, and chiefly to that body that ſhould not meet ſix times in ſixteen hundred years, nay never.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that I never affirmed a general Councel to be the firſt ſubject of the keys, nor the <hi>London-Miniſters,</hi> that I can finde, nor <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that I remember. But the Church-Officers in general, in oppoſition to the <hi>caetus fidelium,</hi> or the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A general Councel is but occaſional, yet is it <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and of more large extent, by reaſon of the general delegation, then any other meeting; and is full of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for the exerting of all Eccleſiaſtical power of the keys, as I conceive. The gift of the keys was primarily to the whole body of Officers, or Organs of the Church reſpectively, as their Offices were capable of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as they were given to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles together, ſo they may he exerciſed together: And ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily to the particular Miniſters or Officers, as being a part of that body. And though the power habitually conſidered be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, yet the conſtant, actual exerciſe thereof is in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations or Claſſes.</p>
                  <p>The Ordinances of God, for the enjoyment and uſe of them, were given to the whole viſible Church for the converſion and edification of the Elect, and if they could meet together, as the Iſraelites did in the wilderneſſe, and the Saints (for ought I know) ſhall in heaven, they might partake of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57278:118"/>
as their rightful portion, but becauſe they cannot meet but in parcels, therefore they have right to enjoy them <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſim,</hi> by vertue of that general gift to the whole, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Congregation or parcel appropriates to it ſelf, as being a member of the whole: and yet it is not notably vain to ſay, The gift of them by God, and his intention in giving them, was to the whole, though they never meet, nor can meet together in this world.</p>
                  <p>So is the caſe of the Miniſters alſo, the Miniſtry is primarily given to the whole body of them, and if they could meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might exerciſe the keys together <hi>conjunctim</hi> (a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, or an epitome whereof is in a general councel) but becauſe they cannot meet but in parcels where they are ſeated, and have a particular call to give eſpecial attendance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they exerciſe them <hi>diviſim,</hi> yet as parts of the whole body of Organs of the Church; and there they ſerve the whole Church, and their diſpenſations have influence into the whole,</p>
                  <p>The third danger, <hi>viz.</hi> the trouble and charge of appeals, and the tryal of cauſes by them that can have no perſonal knowledge of the cauſe, or perſons to be tried, but by information, hath been anſwered before. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>ſ.</hi> 9.</p>

                  <p>His ſecond argument is from the inſtitution of Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaith he) the keys of government were given firſt and fully, entirely and immediatly to the particular Congregation: and this he proves from the Church of the Jews, to which all Church-power was given firſt and fully: but this was (ſaith he) a particular Church, not the univerſal, unleſſe by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe there was no other Church-ſtate in the world at that time.

and they were bound to meet, in their males three times yearly; which pertain not to the Evangelical Church. But in that one Church there were particular Aſſemblies for ordinary worſhip, and extraordinary alſo, and for acts of government, and they had particular Officers, and Eccleſiaſtical rulers over them: and there were appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s reſerved to the great Councel at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo it could not be a type of a Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, for there can be no appeals to that, it being the loweſt Church that can be. The particular <hi>Synagogues</hi> were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Types of the Congregational Churches, for they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſame name, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2. And the Miniſters under the Goſpel are called by the ſame names that the indefinite Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Jewiſh Church were, <hi>viz. Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> Iſa. 66.21. which place is ſpoken of the time under the Goſpel. And if it be granted that the Miniſters of the Goſpel be given to the whole Church, as the Prieſts and Levites were indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the whole Church of the Jews, notwithſtanding any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular relation to the particular Synagogues and places they reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in, and taught, or judged in, it is as much as I contend for. And if by myſtical he meaneth the elect only, or entitively only; it could not be a type of the Church-Catholike ſo, for the Jewiſh Church was viſible and organical.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond proof is from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> which ſaith he was a particular Congregation which was endued with entire power even to excommunication. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall binde,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was not the Inſtitution, neither was there any donation of the keys, but a ſuppoſal of the keys in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, which is a thing confeſſed by all (and this power was alſo in the Jewiſh Synagogues) But this is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken excluſively, that this power is no where elſe. If the rulers of the Synagogue had power to excommunicate (to which it is like Chriſt alluded in that ſpeech) then much more the <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> or higheſt Court: and ſo I conceive it is in the Church of the New Teſtament: If the leaſt combination of Elders have this power given them for matters that concern that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation only, then much more a greater company and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for matters that concern a greater part of the Church
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57278:120"/>
under their combination, and for matters of greater moment then can be tranſacted by the ſmaller company. But the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the keys was to the Apoſtles together, and they were general Officers, and ſtood in relation to no particular Church, and therefore the keys come to the particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or Miniſtry there, as to parts of the whole company of Organs, yet immediatly, and not by commiſſion from any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Court.</p>
                  <p>His third proof is, becauſe the firſt execution of the greateſt act of entire power was exerciſed in a particular Church, without conſulting with the univerſal Church (though the Apoſtles were then ſurviving) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For ought that I know the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a Claſſical Church, and not a meer Congregational one, for there were Churches in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. Beſides the probability that <hi>Cenchrea</hi> was a member thereof. But Sir who requires the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with the Church-Catholike in admitting or ejecting members? Or did the particular Synagogues conſult with the <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> or the whole Church of the Jews when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated any man? Surely they had work enough to do then.</p>
                  <p>His fourth proof or argument is Becauſe entire power was committed to particular men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apoſtles ſeverally, and to all jointly, and therefore not to one viſible governing Church. <hi>Vind.</hi> p. 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By this argument it appears, the power is given not to the Congregation, but to the Miniſters, whoſe repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives the Apoſtles were in receiving the keys, ſeverally and joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is as much as the Presbyterians require, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Miniſters have power to exerciſe their ordinary power jointly together upon a call, as well as ſeverally in their particular Congregations, as the Apoſtles did their extraordinary. Their receiving the keys together ſignifyed their repreſentation of the Miniſters not multiplyed only (as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> would evade it) but conjoyned.</p>
                  <p>His fifth argument is from the reproofs given by Chriſt to the 7. ſeveral Churches in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and not to the combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, though near one another.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For ought appears they might be all Presbyterial Churches, and not Congregational only. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was one, and that was of more Congregations then one, as hath been ſhewed before. But how doth this prove theſe Churches were nor, or might not actually have been in combination, if civil authority would have permited? Were not the Elders of the ſeveral Churches worthy of blame for not doing their duty in their ſeveral Churches? Or will combinations of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions now in Claſſes or Provinces, free their Miniſters from blame in neglecting their du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>es in their particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? A Claſſis or Synod is not to be blamed for the faults in a particular Congregation, which ought to be cenſured in the particular, and not there, neither indeed can be, except they had been brought before them. The ſeveral Churches there had their ſeveral faults, and therefore though the Epiſtle is written to the ſeven, yet it was needful the reproofs ſhould be applied to rhem ſeverally.

                  <p>But Chriſts Kingdom is not to be regulated herein according to worldly polities (as himſelf alſo elſewhere in his <hi>vind.</hi> hath noted) ſo alſo Chriſt hath ſaid of the Officers of his Kingdom, that <hi>it ſhall not be ſo among you,</hi> Mat. 20.26. <hi>i. e.</hi> there ſhall be no ſuperiority among you: and yet they were to be Officers of a body, a kingdom, an Eccleſiaſtical polity. But this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is eaſily ſalved, becauſe though one particular Officer hath not power over another, yet the greater number in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual conſociation, or combination, hath over the leſſe: as it is in a Parliament, or any meeting of the like nature, where all the members are equal <hi>diviſim,</hi> ſeverally taken, yet the leſſe number is ruled, yea, cenſurable by the greater, if there be cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Divers inconveniences he raiſeth from hence, As 1 <hi>a neceſſary existence in one place, and why not at Rome?</hi> 2. <hi>Conſtant ſtanding Officers.</hi> To theſe have been anſwered before. 3. <hi>A common form of faith, diſcipline, worſhip, and profeſſion, agreed on and formally propounded and taken.</hi> I anſwer, theſe are for the eſſentials one in the Church-Catholike, ſet down in the word, and ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

Either it is (faith he) to found the right of Presbyterial government as is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, and to deprive particular Churches of entire power in themſelves, or at leaſt of Independency in their government from other Churches: or elſe to lay a ground work of a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual cure and remedy then hitherto, for all diſtempers of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> The Presbyterial government ſpoileth not Congregations of that due power which Chriſt hath given them, but helpeth and ſtrengthens them in things of greater difficulty wherein they are too weak, and regulateth male-adminiſtrations in the particular Congregations, it ſerveth for the tranſacting of buſineſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concernment: it preſerveth unity in the Church which is the body and family of Chriſt: it ſuppreſſeth errours and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that ariſe and ſpread to the infecting of more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then one, or which particular Congregations cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe.</p>
                  <p>And as for abſolute independency, as it is diſavowed by M. <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> and (as he ſaith) by the greateſt patrons of that way in this Kingdom, and beyond the ſeas: ſo that way which is provided thereby for the curing of errour and ſcandal, meerly by advice and ſwaſion, which may or may not be followed <hi>ad libitum,</hi> it is not a ſufficient remedy againſt obſtinacy therein: and for the Non-communion of Churches by ſiſter-Churches without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I fear it will prove unwarrantable, and is a <hi>vertual</hi> though not <hi>formal</hi> cenſuring of them, though their equals; and is a way not to cure Churches, but to cauſe rents in the Church of Chriſt, and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Neither can this aſſociating of Churches together open a wide gap to tyranny, as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> affirms, any more then aſſociating of families into Congregations, where the irregularities and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages even in their particular houſes are reproveable and cenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The actual union of a Congregation, and the conſtant, near inſpection of the Officers over the the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar families, will more (in the eye of reaſon) intrench upon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-liberties, and call them oftner to cenſure, then the habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

who can when they meet (which is but ſeldom) handle only matters of joint concernment, and of preſumed male admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration brought to them by complaint, can infringe the liberties of thoſe Congregations. And if the Church in general be a ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to all its members, to which there belong certain common rights and priviledges, as ſpiritual food, the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as M. <hi>Ellis</hi> confeſſeth) why not ſpiritual phyſick alſo, which is as neceſſary?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The whole world is one humane ſociety under God the creatour and governour thereof, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29 11. <hi>All that is in the heaven, and in the earth is thine: thine is the Kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.</hi> And yet this makes them not one Kingdom politically, no not habitually; but they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Kingdoms, notwithſtanding they have the ſame head, and the ſame Law of nature common to them all. And therefore the identity of the head and Laws of the Church-Catholike are not ſufficient to make them one Eccleſiaſtical viſible (though but) habitual Kingdom or body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is not <hi>parratio.</hi> For firſt, the laws of nature are not one entire, explicite body of written Laws, as Chriſts Laws for his viſible Church are, but internal and inviſible written in the heart only, and that but dimly, and not apprehended by all, in all the parts thereof alike, through ignorance, rudeneſſe, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, or evil cuſtomes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are no Officers of the whole world, as it is a ſociety, directed by the internal Law of nature: but ſo there are of the viſible Church: and Therefore the viſible Church is more then a ſociety, it is Chriſts external, political King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are ſeveral chief governours over the ſeveral Kingdoms of the world, which are Gods vicegerents, and Gods annointed ones in their Kingdoms; and written municipal laws belonging to every Kingdom, diſtinct from other Kingdoms; and priviledges proper to the ſeveral Kingdoms, wherein the ſubjects of other Kingdoms partake not. But Chriſt hath ſet no ſuch ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſupream, annointed ones over the ſeveral Churches, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſeveral Churches to make any different laws from his, nor from thoſe laws which are common to the whole Church.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57278:123"/>
And the priviledges of the Church are common to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſeveral Churches, and they have freedom to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate together in the holy Ordinances, whereever they dwell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Law of nature is given by God as an inviſible Creator, the Laws of the Church are given by Chriſt, a God man, as a Mediator. As he is God he hath an eſſential right to be governour of angels and men, and all other creatures, but as Mediatour he hath a donative Kingdom of grace, and is a political head of an external viſible Kingdom, which is but one.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, All mankinde are not entred into one body by one external inſtituted ſign, badge, enrowlment, and initial ſeal, not are entred into one explicit, actual Covenant, nor make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, actual profeſſion of ſubjection to the ſame God, or to the ſame ſyſteme of written Laws. And therefore that parallel which theſe two reverend Miniſters M. <hi>Allen</hi> and M. <hi>Shepard</hi> (whom I love and reverence much in the Lord) endeavour to draw between mankinde and the Oecumenical Church in their <hi>Defence unto the nine queſtions or poſitions,</hi> p. 79. will not ſuit and agree in all things.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Yet as all men are one ſociety, though they want Officers, as ſuch, yet are they bound to combine, even from that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal union, to preſerve themſelves, and maintain the Law of nature. Suppoſe there were ſome <hi>circumcelliones</hi> or ſome <hi>conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> that ſought to deſtroy mankinde in general, not becauſe they are of this or that Kingdom, upon ſome particular quarrel, but becauſe they are men: or that endeavoured to poiſon and infect the air, or let in the ſea to drown the earth, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the light of the Sun (if ſuch things were poſſible) or any kinde of wilde beaſt ſhould multiply that would deſtroy all mankinde; then all mankinde ſetting aſide their particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, combinations, Laws, yea, and quarrels, ought and would unite themſelves <hi>as men</hi> to preſerve mankinde, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch common enemies of mankinde. Forreign Nations will combine to vindicate <hi>Jus Gentium</hi> if it be violated. All Nations combine againſt <hi>Pirates,</hi> notwithſtanding particular diſtinctions and oppoſitions, yea, ſo far as mens poſitive laws are general, as
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57278:123"/>
the civil Law reacheth far over many Kingdoms, if there be any oppoſitions or obſtructions that hinder the exerciſe thereof, for common good; all that ſubmit themſelves thereunto would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their particular diſtinctions joyn together to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Much more then ought there to be an union and combination between the ſeveral parts of the Church, which hath the ſame head and King over the whole, of our own nature, who hath given us one ſyſteme of written laws, and but one charter for the whole, and made Officers for the good of the whole, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing them with an habitual power of office to adminiſter all his Ordinances in any part of the Church upon a call. And if they could meet together, they might actually teach and rule the whole Church, as one Congregation, as M <hi>Ellis</hi> granteth: and becauſe they cannot ſo meet, yet by the ſame reaſon if a great part of them meet together, the Elders ſet over them may teach and rule them joyntly together, as well as ſeverally aſunder. For the greater number of Churches being conſidered as combined and conſociated parts of the whole, bear the ſame relation in a proportion to the leſſe, that the greater number in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation do to the leſſe: and therefore if the major part in the Congregational Elderſhip ſhall overrule the leſſe by their votes, ſo by proportion ſhall the greater number of any greater Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery whether <hi>Claſſical, Provincial,</hi> or <hi>National,</hi> &amp;c. being in actual conſociation and combination, overrule the leſſe, if they diſſent.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe there are ſo many ſuperſtitions, errours and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in the <hi>Aſian, African, European</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Churches, as M. <hi>A.</hi> and M. <hi>S.</hi> in their <hi>defence</hi> p 92. do take notice of, (which book I confeſſe it was mine unhappineſſe not to hear of until this tractate of mine was tranſcribed for the preſſe, and who have dealt exceeding candidly upon this queſtion, and ſeem to yield the faireſt conceſſions toward the univerſality, unity, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grality, and priority of the whole Church in ſome reſpects of reaſon, <hi>pag.</hi> 77. though not ſo much as is contended for) yet I ſay for theſe things ſake, I ſhould be very tender in defining (as the caſe now ſtandeth) what Churches, or how farre the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Churches may with convenience or ſafety enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual

                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:57278:126"/>The minor I prove, becauſe the Covenant of grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, and the firſt Evangelical promiſe that ever was made in the world, was to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> repreſenting all mankinde, and therefore conſequently the whole Church of God. This was before there was any diviſion or diſtinction made of Churches into Jew and Gentile, National or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational.</p>
               <p>Again, the main commiſſion for gathering the Evangelical Church was, <hi>Go teach all Nations, and baptize them, in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost,</hi> Mat. 28. And this was before any diviſions or ſubdiviſions were appointed: and they were ſecondarily brought in, for order and convenient adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ordinances, and communication of members, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of buſineſſe: and they being ſimilar parts of the whole, receive their particular diſtinctions from external, accidental, and adventitious particularities, as the places where they exiſt, the particular Officers ſet over them; their purity or impurity, eminency or obſcurity, multitude or paucity, zeal or remisneſſe, antiquity or late conſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They all retain the general eſſential form and difference from heathens, and among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as parts of a ſimilar body, are diſtinguiſhed but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental differences.</p>
               <p>And that promiſe that <hi>the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> is primarily given to the Church-Catholike viſible have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>; For that in heaven is not aſſailed by the gates of hell, but only that on earth. And though it may ſeem to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the inviſible only, yet to thoſe as viſible; for ſo they are aſſailed by perſecutions and hereſies.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>He that beleeveth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mar. 16. This doth primarily belong to the Church Catholike, and that a viſible Church, becauſe capable of Baptiſm, and though it be applicable to every member of any particular Congregation, yet not as being a member of that particular ſociety or confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but as being in the general Covenant, and ſo a member of the Church Catholike, to which that promiſe was made. Yea, look over all the promiſes in the New Teſtament, and you ſhall finde them under in general, without the leaſt reſpect or reference to the particular confederations or Congregations wherein the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57278:126"/>
beleevers lived. In any ſimilar body, as water, the accidents doe not primarily pertain to this or that particular drop, and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily to the whole, but firſt to the whole, and ſecondarily to this or that drop. So the promiſes and priviledges of the Church do not primarily belong to this or that particular Church, and ſecondarily to the Catholike: but firſt to the Catholike, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily to this or that particular Congregation or perſon, as being a member thereof.</p>
               <p>The Laws alſo are given to the whole Church primarily, as the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are to the whole Kingdom primarily, and to the particular diviſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The like may be ſaid of the priviledges of the Church. Two main priviledges of the Church are <hi>federal holineſſe</hi> of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of viſible beleevers, and <hi>right to the Ordinances, on for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>For <hi>federal or covenant-holineſſe,</hi> whereby the children of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beleevers are, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This I prove thus. That which ſhould have been, though the particular relation to a particular Congregation had never been, and which continueth when the particular relation ceaſeth, that is not a proper priviledge of that relation, but ſuch is federal-holineſſe, in regard of relation to any particular Congregation.

               <p>For Baptiſm, it cannot be a priviledge of the particular Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for if a Pagan be converted he muſt be baptized before he can be admitted a member of the particular Congregation, and this muſt be by ſome Miniſter, Therefore baptiſm is a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Church-Entitive; and a Miniſter can, yea, and muſt ſometimes exert his power of office, not only beyond his own Congregation, even into others, but beyond the Church orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical into the Church-Entitive, to ſet Chriſts ſeal there. And for the children of viſible beleevers though born never ſo farre from the place where the particular Miniſter liveth which hath the actual care of his parents, be it by ſea or by land, any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may adminiſter Baptiſm to them, becauſe they are holy. <hi>Infantes baptizandi ſunt, non ut ſancti ſint, ſed quia ſancti ſunt.</hi> Whitak.</p>

                  <hi>The promiſe is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2.39. This promiſe is that external Covenant to which Baptiſm doth belong; for it is brought in as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to move them to repentance, and receiving of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and declareth their right, and their childrens right, which is nothing elſe but the call of God, and their anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>The Sacraments are not ſeals of the particular Covenant, but the general, and therefore all that are in the general Covenant have right thereto, as they are capable. The 5. Apologiſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſome of them had children born after they were actually in this way of communion, which were baptized by ſome of our Miniſters in our Pariſhional Congregations. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol.

               <p>And for the Lords Supper, it is a priviledge not ſpringing from the particular Covenant, but the general: and as all that were circumciſed were bound to keep the Paſſeover, whereever they dwelt, ſo every baptized perſon being of age, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fir, is bound to receive the Lords Supper, and therefore hath a right thereto, though his condition of calling, or other accidents hinder him from a fixed memberſhip. And in Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Churches the brethren of one Congregation commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate at the Lords table in other Congregations, as occaſion is offered: but ſurely it cannot be by vertue of a particular Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, entred into with their own members, for that can give right no where elſe, but it is by vertue of a Covenant that is common to all viſible beleevers, which is the general Covenant.

It is againſt the order of nature that the particular Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which is but humane, arbitrary, mutable, extinguiſhible and accidental, ſhould precede the general which is divine, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, immutable, perpetual, and eſſential to a Chriſtian: it is as if a man ſhould firſt be made a freeman of <hi>London,</hi> and then a Denizon of <hi>England.</hi> Indeed he is not capable of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges that are peculiar to that Congregation, except he be a member of it, but baptiſm is a general priviledge of every ſubject of Chriſts Kingdom. Neither have we any precept in the Scripture for the precedency of the particular Covenant before the general: nor any example or intimation of any ſuch practice in Scripture, but of the contrary. What particular, Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Covenant did thoſe that were baptized by John Baptiſt, or Chriſts Diſciples enter into before baptiſm? or the Eunuch, the Jaylor and his houſhold, or <hi>Lydia,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Cornelius,</hi> or the 3000. converted by <hi>Peter,</hi> that were inhabitants of ſo many ſeveral countries? True indeed ſome of them were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Jewiſh Church, and ſo in the general Covenant, but what is that to the making of them members of a particular, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Congregational Church? Infants are acknowledged to be members of the Church before baptiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 25. and <hi>Bucer Loc.</hi> 47. cited for it, yet they enter into no ſuch Covenant before baptiſm.

It is a marvel that ſeeing ſo much weight lyeth on this particular Church-Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the intereſt in the ſeals of the Covenant of grace, the Scripture ſhould never give any intimation of it, or directions about it.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of hearing the word; any viſible belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may hear it whereever God giveth him opportunity, not as a heathen, or man without, but as his rightful portion.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57278:130"/>
he teacheth all; as a King he ruleth all primarily, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars ſecondarily. So is it alſo in Chriſts external Kingdom, as well as his internal.

               <p>Fifthly, All the members of the particular Churches are
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57278:131"/>
members of the Church-Catholike, yea, that relation belongs firſt unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they be born within the pale of the Church,</hi> they have fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holineſſe, and are <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, not becauſe members of this or that Congregation, but becauſe born of parents within the general, external Covenant, and ſo within the Church-Catholike. <hi>If they be converted from heathens,</hi> they are not firſt converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this or that particular Church, but converted firſt into the Church-Catholike, and then ſecondarily admitted members of this or that particular Congregation, after they be baptized. A man may dwell it one City, and hear the word of God by accident in another city, and thereby be converted, but he is not converted to be a member of the Church where he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but into the Church-Catholike. So that <hi>particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations are made up of members of the Catholike,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt properly in that ſenſe are ſaid to be <hi>Ortae.</hi> For ſuch a convert may joyn himſelf after his converſion to what Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he pleaſeth to inhabit among. If a man comes into a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh that is an heathen, he is not a member of that particular Church (though he ſhall be a civil member of the Town) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe be is not a member of the Church-Catholike, but if he be a Chriſtian, then he is a member of that particular Church where he reſideth, or fit ſo to be, and ought not to be denied admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or communion (if no juſt exception lieth againſt him) though he had never been a member of any other Congregation. The particular companies in <hi>London</hi> are made up only of free-men that are joyned together in ſome particular body or ſociety, belonging to ſuch or ſuch a Hall; now the firſt notion that comes upon any ſuch perſons or companies, is, that they are free-men of <hi>London,</hi> and ſecondarily that they are diſtinct from other free-men, by being of this or that particular company, belonging to ſuch a Hall. So it is for all Churches: firſt of all, the members are conceived to be <hi>free of the Church-Catholike,</hi> and ſecondarily, <hi>diſtinct by their ſocieties,</hi> in this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>And though haply this ſimilitude holdeth not in every thing, as the not removing from one company to another, and being received in there, becauſe he is a free-man; yet it is free for
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57278:131"/>
any Chriſt to change his particular relation from one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to another, becauſe he is a Chriſtian, and takes not up his firſt freedom into a particular Congregation or company, but into the Catholike. They are made members of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and kingdom of Chriſt, by converſion to the faith, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiated by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, but are ſecondarily made members of a particular Congregation by cohabitation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation. He that is free of one Corporation may not thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remove to another, and ſet up his trade as a free-man there, becauſe they are conſtituted by ſeveral charters: but the whole Church-Catholike hath but one charter, and by that a Chriſtian is free in any Eccleſiaſtical Corporation, whereever he pleaſe to inhabit, and may not by them be inhibited. As he that was free of <hi>Rome</hi> was free whereever he became in all the Romane Empire.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a man had abundance of ſheep, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> who had 14000. and theſe ſheep had all one brand of the owners upon them, and theſe ſheep were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral flocks, uniſter ſeveral ſhepheards, in ſeveral ſheep-walks, of the ſame owners, according to his appointment: the primary conſideration of any of theſe ſheep or flocks, is not that they are under ſuch a keeper, in ſuch a ſheep-walk, but the firſt conſideration of them is, they are ſuch a mans ſheep, bearing his brand, and fed by his ſervants, on his ground, and then the more particular and ſecondary conſideration and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that they are under ſuch a particular ſhepheard, in ſuch a walk. And the like may be ſaid in a civil reſpect; the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of a man, is that he is an Engliſh man, and ſo a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this kingdom, and the ſecondary that he is a <hi>Suffolk</hi> man, or an <hi>Ipſwich</hi> man. So the firſt conſideration in a ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a man, or a Congregation, is, that they are the Lords people, that they belong to Chriſt, and are his ſubjects, born, or converted to him, fed, and nouriſhed, and ruled by his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Officers, and then the particular ſecondary notion is, that they are fed and ruled by ſuch Elders, in ſuch a place or ſociety.</p>
               <p>It is an uſual ſimilitude on all hands to compare the Church to the Sea or Ocean; which though it be one, yet as it waſheth
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57278:132"/>

               <p>And the Angels themſelves (by whoſe names Miniſters are called in 2. and 3. of <hi>Revelation</hi>) they are miniſtring ſpirits ſent out for the good of the Elect, but it is in ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and not to them.</p>
               <p>And if a Miniſter of this or that Congregation be not a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Church-Catholike viſible, <hi>then he is no Minister out of his own Congregation, and therefore cannot preach or adminiſter any Sacrament as a Miniſter, out of his own Congregation,</hi> yea, if any members of another Congregation ſhould come and hear a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter preach in his own Congregation, he could not preach to them, nor they hear him as a Miniſter but only as a gifted bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And though he may pray and beſeech his own flock as an Ambaſſadour of Chriſt, to be reconciled unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. yet he cannot ſay ſo to any other, except he be an Ambaſſadour in office unto others alſo. And if he be a Miniſter to one member beſides his own Congregation, then is he ſo indefinitely to all, by the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <p>But if he deliver the word as a Miniſter to his own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation only, then the ſame word which is delivered at the ſame time by the ſame man, is delivered by vertue of the Miniſterial office to ſome, and to others <hi>ex officio charitatis generali,</hi> only

He whoſe office is limited within, and ſtands wholly in relation to a particular place, is out of office when he is out of that place, as a Mayor of a Corporation, and a Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a Pariſh: but ſo is not a Miniſter, he is no private man as ſoon as he is out of his meeting-houſe, or the limits of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>And though indeed he be more peculiarly their Paſtour or Biſhop, one that hath the overſight of them in the Lord, in a more immediate, eſpecial manner actually, yet this extends to all places, whereever he or they ſhall come by occaſion, though never ſo far from their dwellings, but ſo is not a Mayor or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable. And beſides this particular relation he hath an indefinite office, he is a Miniſter in general to all others, and may exert his power of office to them, as God giveth occaſion, and they give him a call, without taking a new eſpecial relation to them: but ſo cannot a Mayor or Conſtable, though they were entreated to uſe their office out of their limits, becauſe they are onely particular Officers. See this more fully in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. and 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:57278:133"/>Suppoſe a Miniſters flock by mortality, or the ſword ſhould be diſſolved, extinct and ceaſe, indeed he ceaſeth to be their Paſtor, becauſe the correlative faileth, but he ceaſeth not to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel. A King or Mayor haply ceaſe to be ſo any longer, if his Kingdom or Corporation ſhould ſink or be ſwallowed up, becauſe there is no Catholike Kingdom or Corporation whereof they were Officers, but the office of the Miniſter ceaſeth not, becauſe he was an Officer of the Church-Catholike, which correlative ſinketh not: but ſtill his power <hi>in actu primo</hi> to diſpenſe all the Ordinances of Chriſt, which a ſingle Officer can perform, remaineth, only his call <hi>ad actum ſecundum ſive exercitum, pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the polity of the Church for order, ceaſeth, becauſe they are cut off that gave him a call thereto.</p>
               <p>An Objection againſt this I finde made by thoſe two Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Miniſters M. <hi>A.</hi> and M. <hi>S.</hi> in their <hi>Defence,</hi> p. 208. It is to this purpoſe. If Ordination of a Miniſter be an indeleble chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter (like Baptiſm) and ceaſeth not when his particular relation to a Congregation ceaſeth, why then ſhould not a ruling-Elder or Deacon remain an Elder or Deacon in the Church, though their particular relations ceaſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If you pleaſe to caſt your eye back to the anſwer of an Objection of M. <hi>Hookers</hi> that is like to this, <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. it may afford ſome light to the anſwering of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to which I referre you, being loth to repeat the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I premiſe alſo, that for ought I can finde, both ruling-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Deacons, ſhould continue in their offices as long as they lived, if the Congregations or Presbyterial Churches which choſe them be not diſſolved, or if they be not ejected by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I deny not but that the Deacons office may ceaſe at the diſſolution of the Church that choſe them, becauſe the ſubject of their office. <hi>viz.</hi> contributions, ceaſe with the contributers: and ſo it may be ſaid of the ruling Elders alſo, becauſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular object of their office ceaſeth; and yet both of them while they are in their offices may extend the execution of their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beyond the particular Church that choſe them, to a greater
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57278:134"/>
part of the Church, and poſſibly to the whole.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a great difference between the Miniſter of the word and the ruling-Elder, the firſt hath two keys, <hi>viz.</hi> of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and diſcipline, the other hath but one, <hi>viz.</hi> of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. The ſuperiour order is conceived to comprehend the power of the inferiour; and ſo the Apoſtles had all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the inferiour, even of Deacons; the like may be ſaid of the reſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The key of diſcipline cannot be exerciſed but in a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore muſt ceaſe when that ceaſeth, which muſt be at the diſſolution of the particular Church, whether Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational or Presbyterial which choſe them: but the key of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, with which the Miniſter of the word is inveſted, may be exerciſed by a ſingle perſon out of combination, and therefore that ceaſeth not at ſuch diſſolution. Indeed the exerciſe of his key of diſcipline is ſuſpended by ſuch diſſolution, yet is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him habitually <hi>in actu primo,</hi> becauſe it is annexed to (if not comprehended under) his key of doctrine. And if there can be any uſe made of that poſition of diſpenſing Ordinances to other Churches <hi>mediantibus candelabris,</hi> it is more proper to this key then the other, becauſe his particular relation to the particular Church lets him into the particular combination, and ſo into a greater upon occaſion of a call.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And for ought I know this might be the reaſon why the Apoſtle changed the manner of ſpeech from the concrete to the abſtract, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. from teachers to helps, governments; to intimate that they that have thoſe offices ceaſe to be Officers when they ceaſe to be helps, or to be emploied in government, but the others are affixed indelebly unto their perſons, and may be exerciſed more at large in the Church, and out of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſingly without actual combination.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a part of a County wherein a Juſtice of peace for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dwelt, and executed his office, ſhould ſink, yet, if he be preſerved, he remaineth ſtill in his office, and may execute it in any other place in the County, where he ſhall dwell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his office ſtood in reference to the whole County, though he exerciſed it actually but in one place. So is the Miniſters office (as a Miniſter of the Goſpel) general, though they
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57278:134"/>
take but particular diviſions and parcels of the Church to feed and watch over actually and particularly, and do not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſtretch themſelves within anothers particular line and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits without a call, by permittance, or entreaty, or combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And that a Miniſter is a Miniſter of the Church Catholike viſible, appears thus. <hi>He that can miniſterially admit or eject a member into, or out of the Church-Catholike viſible, is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and Officer of the Church-Catholike viſible, But every Miniſter by Baptiſm, or Excommunication admitteth or eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth members into, or out of the Church-Catholike viſible. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Argument I finde more fully laid down by <hi>Apollonius,</hi> 
                  <q>Paſtor ut Paſtor exercet multos actus miniſteriales, non tantum erga Eccleſiam ſuam particularem cui ordinario ministerio eſt affixus, ſed erga Eccleſias alias particulares, &amp; Provinciales, &amp; Nationales, imò &amp; erga Eccleſiam univerſalem: Nam per Baptiſmum membra in Eccleſiam univerſalem admittir: per ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicationem membra, non tantum ex ſua particulari, ſed etiam Provinciali, Nationali, &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſali Eccleſia eijcit, <hi>Matth. 18.18, 19.</hi> Ex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Of excommunication I ſpake before, proving that it ejecteth a man from communion with the whole Church-Catholike vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>This M <hi>Ellis</hi> ſaith is not formally but virtually done. But I anſwer, then it will follow that by Baptiſm they are not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted into the Church-Catholike, but virtually. But into what Church were they baptized that were baptized by <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles, before particular Congregations were conſtituted? And now they are conſtituted, it cannot be ſaid they are formally baptized into them, for haply the perſon bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in a particular Congregation, will never be a member thereof, but of ſome other. Our brethren hold that it is entring
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57278:135"/>
into their particular Covenant, that makes them actually mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Congregation, and that the children of their own Church-members are by baptiſm but incompleat members of that Congregation.</p>
               <p>Our brethren will not ſay (I ſuppoſe) that thoſe perſons that go from hence to them, being already baptized, are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and without, though they have loſt their particular memberſhip? Surely they account them ſubjects of Chriſt, and under his ſeal; why elſe doe they admit any of them members of their Congregations (into which they may admit only Chriſts Subjects) and ſet no new ſeal of Baptiſm upon them?</p>
               <p>And as Baptiſm admitteth <hi>primally, formally,</hi> and <hi>antecedenter</hi> into the Church-Catholike, and <hi>ſecondarily</hi> and <hi>conſequenter</hi> into that particular Congregation, ſo the ſame order is in ejection by excommunication. If a finger were added to a mans hand, the primary conſideration is, that there is a limb given to that man, ſuch a man we ſay hath recovered his ſight or hearing, though it be ſeated in the eye or ear.</p>
               <p>And if a hand could be conceived to cut, nip, or ſear off a gangreened finger, it would not be conceived as an act of the hand only, but as an act of the man, and the man would be ſaid to looſe a limb primarily, and the ſecondary conſideration is, that the particular hand hath loſt a finger. When D. <hi>Cranmer</hi> burnt off his right hand, it was not the act of the arm only, but of the whole man primarily. And if this be ſo of members that are fixed, and have their particular place and office in the body, and cannot be removed and ſet any where elſe: then much more of the members of the Church, which were members of the Church-Entitive, before they received their particular memberſhip in any Congregation, and may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from one Congregation to another, as oft as occaſion or conveniency ſerveth.</p>
               <p>But becauſe excommunication is an act of many, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. I will therefore inſiſt more particularly upon Baptiſm, which is an act of a ſingle Paſtor or Miniſter, though paſſed with the knowledge and conſent of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:57278:135"/>That by Baptiſm we are admitted into the Church, I think is without doubt: for if perſons baptized be not members of the viſible Church, <hi>then the ſeal of the Covenant is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to thoſe that are and remain o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of the Church, and ſo were no initial ſeal, which were abſurd to ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. <hi>Ball</hi> in his Catechiſm hath this paſſage. <q>Baptiſm is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of our ingrafting into Chriſt, communion with him, and entrance into the Church, for which he citeth, <hi>Mat</hi> 28.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38. And afterwards explains himſelf. It doth (ſaith he) ſolemnly ſignifie and ſeal their ingrafting into Chriſt, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they are acknowledged members of the Church, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And that we are thereby admitted members, not of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation but the Church-Catholike, appears, becauſe <hi>we are baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. And this appears further, becauſe he that is baptized in one Congregation, is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized all over the world, and is not to be re-baptized, but is taken as a member of the Church whereever he becomes. See before <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. Now that <hi>baptizing is an act of office, appears,</hi> Joh. 1.33. <hi>He that ſent me to baptize.</hi> And <hi>Go teach all Nations, and baptize them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. was the ſubſtance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Commiſſion. And though <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 1.17. ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize but to preach the Goſpel,</hi> yet that is meant not principally, for he was ſent alſo to baptize, elſe he might not have done it, which we reade he did.</p>
               <p>And that by an act of this office we are baptized into the Church-Catholike, appears, becauſe <hi>John Baptiſt baptized all Jeruſalem, Judea, and all the region round about Iordan. And the Diſciples of Christ made and baptized more Diſciples then Iohn, and that without any relation to any particular Congregations;</hi> which had it been neceſſary, or had baptiſm been ordained in reference to particular Congregations, they could have combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them into. So <hi>Peter</hi> cauſed <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his friends to be baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.48. but no mention is made of any Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation into which they were baptized. And <hi>Philip</hi> baptized the <hi>Eunuch</hi> but not into any particular Congregation. Into what Congregation did <hi>Ananias</hi> baptize <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 9.18.? Or how can it appear that <hi>Ananias</hi> was an Evangeliſt, or any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57278:136"/>
Officer? he is called a Diſciple at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he was one of the Elders there, but that <hi>Paul</hi> was ever a fixed member of any particular Congregation, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not.</p>
               <p>That which is anſwered to this is, that they which admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred Baptiſm ſo indefinitely, were extraordinary general Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, which are now ceaſed. But this ſalves it not, for if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate right to Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> comes to the receiver by being a member of a particular inſtituted Congregation, as M. <hi>Norton,</hi> and M. <hi>A.</hi> and M. <hi>S.</hi> in <hi>Def.</hi> Ch. 4. pag. 73. tels us, then <hi>John Baptiſt, Chriſts Diſciples, Philip</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> (though he had been an Evangeliſt) adminiſtred it to ſuch as had no actual and immediate right to receive it. Indeed the anſwer implyeth a more large, actual, extenſive power in the adminiſtrers, either to have conſtituted new Churches, or to adminiſter in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Churches, but it gives not them power to adminiſter any Ordinance of God to ſuch as had no right thereto, nor power to the receivers to receive it without actual right, in an undue order. It gives them not <hi>jus in re,</hi> who had in themſelves only <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> as their diſtinction is. And the proof brought <hi>p.</hi> 76. out of <hi>Act.</hi> 5.14. is, as I conceive, miſtaken. Their words are theſe. <q>Beleevers were added, firſt, they were beleevers ſtanding in that ſpiritual relation to Chriſt and his <hi>whole body,</hi> and then added to the Church by viſible combination.</q> But it is not ſaid they were added to the <hi>Church,</hi> but added to the <hi>Lord:</hi> and it were incongruous to gather thence that they were firſt beleevers, and after that were added to the Lord by a ſecond act, ſeeing their adding to the Lord was by beleeving, and that which added them to the Lord the head and King, added them to the body and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And whereas they ſay, that Juſtification and Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> flow immediatly from internal union with Chriſt, but inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ordinances and Priviledges mediatly, and in ſuch an order as Chriſt hath in wiſedom ordained, and the nature of viſible government and Ordinances of Chriſt neceſſarily require, <hi>pag.</hi> 76.</q> If they mean by it, being members of particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: then would I know whether hearing the word publikely preached or read, or joyning in publike ſinging, or
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57278:136"/>
in keeping a day of publike thankſgiving, or faſting, or making rows, or taking oaths, which are inſtituted Ordinances, may not be permitted to any but ſuch as are members of particular Congregations?</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles carried about one with them whom they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>So <hi>Tychicus</hi> Col. 4.7. is called <hi>a beloved brother and faithful Miniſter, and fellow-ſervant in the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.21. he hath the ſame ſtile given him. Certainly he could not be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Miniſter to both thoſe diſtant Churches: and haply he was ſo to neither of them, if we may give any credit to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotheus,</hi> who ſaith he was Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in <hi>Bithynia.

               <p>The major is undenyable, The minor appears, becauſe none can be admitted into a particular Congregation, except he be judged firſt of the Church-Catholike, and that not meerly Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but under the ſeal of the Covenant adminiſtred by ſome Officer, and ſo ſtands bound to ſubmit himſelf to all Chriſts Ordinances and Officers, by one of which he receives his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. So again, though he change his habitation never ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, bear relation to never ſo many particular Congregations one after another, yet in all thoſe the general relation holdeth ſtil: he is ſtill a baptized viſible member of the Church-Catholike, and therefore to be received whereever he cometh into any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57278:137"/>
found them lyars, and ſo would not receive them. And our brethren undertake to inflict the ſentence of Non-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (for ſo they call it a ſentence of Non-communion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. <hi>Apollog. Nar.</hi> pag. 18. and 19.) againſt ſtrangers, yea, whole Churches: but how it will ſtand with ſome other principles of theirs, I know nor: if it be a ſentence denounced, it is a cenſure, and ſo an act of diſcipline exerciſed againſt thoſe out of their particular confederation; which in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is but changing an old warranted cenſure of the Church, into a new and doubtful one: but both ſeem to agree in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral nature of a ſentence or cenſure.</p>
               <p>Surely hereticks and falſe teachers are not to be left to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate only, but to be referred to Eccleſiaſtical trial: for thoſe things come not under the cognizance of the civil Magiſtrate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly: or he may be an heathen, and will not regard an heretick, nor can judge of him, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.15.</p>
               <p>And if every kingdom will try murther, treaſon, or any foul crime committed in the ſame, though by a ſtranger or alien, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the crimes are againſt their laws and ſovereign, though their Laws pertain not to the countrey where the forreigner was born and dwelleth: then much more ſhall every Church try thoſe members of the Church-Catholike, reſiding among them, for their crimes or falſe doctrines, ſeeing they have all the ſame ſovereign head, the ſame Laws, and are all one habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual body.</p>
               <p>Again, It is no ſinne for a man to remove from one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to another, as oft as occaſion or conveniency require, but for a man to remove out of the Church-Catholike, either Entitive by diſclaiming the doctrine and faith of Chriſt, or orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical by refuſing to joyn to any Chriſtian ſociety, or to be under, and ſubmit unto any Church-diſcipline, is a great ſinne and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy. No man is accounted a ſchiſmatick for removing from one Congregation to another, but he that ſhall ſeparate himſelf from all Church-communion, and ſhall rend himſelf from the Church-Catholike, he is a ſchiſmatick he is an Apoſtate. And therefore the ſeveral ſects though they pretend, becauſe of wants or blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to rend from the Church of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. yet not from the Church-Catholike by no means, becauſe they know that were a ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:57278:138"/>Eightly, <hi>That Church from which the particular Churches ſpring, and to which they are as an additament and encreaſe, that is the prime Church, but that is the Church-Catholike.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The major is clear of it ſelf, The minor appears, becauſe they are the inſtrument to convert the reſt, and bring them into the ſame kingdom of Chriſt with themſelves, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. <hi>God added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> That little handful to which the Catholike charter was firſt given, leavened the whole world, and brought them in as an addition to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>They were to be witneſſes in Jeruſalem, and then in Iudaea, and to the ends of the earth.</hi> Act. 1.8. <hi>For the Law ſhall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem,</hi> Iſa. 2.3. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend the red of his ſtrength out of Zion,</hi> Pſal. 110.2. It was with the Church then as was ſaid of the river of <hi>Eden,</hi> Gen. 2.10. <hi>A river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted into four heads.</hi> So the water of life flowed from Zion into the four quarters of the world.</p>
               <p>As there is no creek but hath its riſe from, and continuity with the Main, and receives influence from it: ſo there is no particular Church but hath his firſt riſe, and miniſterial influence from the Church-Catholike, and received the Goſpel and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of it from thence miniſterially. God cals no Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Churches by inſpiration only, but by the miniſtry of thoſe that are members of the Church-Catholike, or ſome part of it. God would not have <hi>Cornelius</hi> inſtructed by an Angel, though he could have done it, but by <hi>Peter</hi> a Miniſter of the Church-Evangelical: and likewiſe the <hi>Eunuch</hi> by <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Church-Catholike is as the Sea, and particular Churches as ſo many creeks or arms receiving a tincture and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her waters. The Church-Catholike is as the tree, Chriſt as the root, the particular Churches as branches, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes the compariſon. Shee is the <hi>mother,</hi> and they as <hi>daughters</hi> born of her, and receiving from her miniſterially both nature and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> indeed was called <hi>extraordinarily</hi> from heaven by Chriſt himſelf, the head of the Church (and not by an Angel) that he might be, or ſome conceive, a type of the ſecond call of the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57278:138"/>
Jews, who (as ſome hold) ſhall be ſo called, as he was, <hi>by the appearing of the ſign of the Son of man:</hi> and therefore that Church is ſaid to come down from God out of heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2, 10. And the ground of this type they take from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>For this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me first Ieſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſufferance for a pattern,</hi>

               <p>But theſe things are myſteries, and I dare not be too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in them, yet ſhould they come to paſſe, they infringe not this truth, becauſe their converſion ſhall come from the head, root, and fountain it ſelf of the Church; as <hi>Abrahams</hi> call was. And no queſtion but Chriſt did convert many in the daies of his fleſh, when he was actually and viſibly a member of the Church here below. And if any be converted by ſecret inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or revelation, and neither converted nor fed by any external Ordinances, as haply ſome infants of heathens or any Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as <hi>Plato</hi> (if haply there were any ſo converted) they are not to be accounted of the viſible Church, and ſo not belonging to this queſtion.</p>
               <p>There is a double riſe of the particular Churches out of the general.</p>
               <p>Firſt, All Congregations are made up of the members of the Church Entitive, or of perſons that are viſible beleevers, and their children, which are holy, being born in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the Church-Catholike as Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Corporation, already inveſted with Evangelical Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Priviledges, and it affords a twofold riſe to thoſe that are added to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are inſtrumental by their preaching, godly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and ſometimes by their ſufferings, to convert thoſe that are aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They give them miniſterially their admittance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and as I may ſay freedom in the Church, both as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate members, and if any of them be ordained Officers, it is by ſuch as are Officers before, and not <hi>quâ</hi> Officers of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches (for it is an extrinſecal act to them as ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered)
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57278:139"/>
but of the general. And in the erecting of a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in <hi>New-England,</hi> there is to be the conſent, advice, and help of the Elders of neighbour-Churches, they are not only to allow thereof, but alſo to ordain them Elders, which cannot be an act of particular Officers, for it is no act toward their own flocks, it is extraneous to them: but it is as they are are habitually general Officers, and this occaſion draws forth their power for the good and encreaſe of the whole.</p>

               <p>It is true, God commands true piety: and no man ſhall ſee Gods face in bliſſe, nor be of the inviſible company without it. But I ſpeak what is requiſite <hi>in fora Eccleſiae,</hi> and what matter muſt be for a viſible Church, and then I conceive it is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely requiſite that the perſons ſhould be truly godly to make them members thereof. For if it were otherwiſe, no man could
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57278:139"/>
tell when he is in a true Church, or who are true members, or whoſe childe ought to be baptized. And if the living members of Chriſt were the only or eſſential members of a viſible Church, then none are true eſſential members but they: and a truly godly Miniſter is a more eſſential Miniſter then another, and the Ordinances adminiſtred by him, are more eſſentially admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred then by another: and then the vertue of the Ordinance ſhould depend not on Chriſts Inſtitution, but on the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the perſon adminiſtring. And haply after many years living under a Miniſter that ſeemed godly, that Miniſter by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away ſhews himſelf that he was not ſo, and then all thoſe Ordinances were null, being adminiſtred by one that was not only no Miniſter, but no true member of the Church.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſanctification is commanded by God to every one that will dedicate himſelf unto God, is clear. But for the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57278:140"/>
ſuppoſition of it in all, it will be hard to prove. God enjoyned his people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to conſecrate themſelves unto him to be his people, yet he did not ſuppoſe them all to be godly: for he expreſſeth the contrary of them; neither did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> ſuppoſe ſo of them, not the Prophets, for they expreſſe the quite contrary.</p>
               <p>And if we come to the New Teſtament, it cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> or Chriſts Apoſtles did in their perſonal judgements apprehend all thoſe to be truly godly whom they baptized and dedicated to God. For <hi>Iohn</hi> called the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees a generation of vipers,</hi> and yet addeth, <hi>I indeed baptize you with water,</hi> Matth. 3.7, 11. Indeed they confeſſed their ſins, and it is like promiſed amendment, and ſo will the worſt in our Congregations doe, though they never perform it. The ground therefore upon which this ſuppoſal is to be, muſt not be any mans perſonal particular judgement, built upon ſuch evidence as may convince the underſtanding of a judicious, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Miniſter or Chriſtian, that the perſons are truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but an Eccleſiaſtical judgement <hi>in foro Eccleſiae</hi> raiſed upon ſuch grounds as the Miniſters of God directed by God have formerly gone upon; which conditions if they finde they are not to deny adminiſtration of the ſeals unto, which are the ſeals of the viſible not inviſible Church. The ſame cauſes and rules are of admiſſion that are of ejection <hi>vice verſâ:</hi> and as no man is to be cenſured and caſt out of the viſible Church, becauſe the Elders particular judgement makes them think the man hath not the true power of godlineſſe, and grace of God in ſincerity, except he commit that which deſerves an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical cenſure: ſo neither is admiſſion to be denyed to any man that deſires to dedicate himſelf unto God, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and profeſſe ſubjection to Chriſt in all his Ordinances, though it be ſuſpected by judicious Chriſtians, that he hath not the true work of grace in his heart. The Church of God in their Eccleſiaſtical judgement cenſureth only ignorance, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and ſcandal. A Scholar that is admitted into a ſchool, is not admitted becauſe he is <hi>doctus,</hi> but <hi>ut fit doctus,</hi> and if he will ſubmit to the rules of the ſchool, and apply himſelf to learn, it is enough for his admiſſion: the like may be ſaid of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57278:140"/>
the Church viſible which is Chriſts ſchool. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> did not in his conſcience think they had all actually, really and compleatly repented and reformed themſelves whom he baptized, but he <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized them unto repentance,</hi> Mat. 3.11. and they by receiving the ſame bound themſelves to endeavour the practice thereof. It were a ſad caſe for Miniſters if they were bound to admit none, or adminiſter the Lords Supper to none, but ſuch as were truly godly, or that they judged in their conſcience to be ſo, or were bound to eject all that they judged were not ſo. I fear the Elders in <hi>New-England</hi> do not in their conſciences judge ſo of all their members. It is not confederation that can give right to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, if by Gods laws they ought not to have them.</p>
               <p>There is a great difference between the viſible and inviſible Church: the rules of the one will not ſerve for the other. No Miniſter could ever adminiſter the Sacrament without ſin, if he ought not to adminiſter it to any but ſuch as are truly godly: neither hath God given us any rules to judge certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the truth of grace in any man: but the moſt judicious Divine in the world may be deceived by a cunning hypocrite: And to ſalve this by ſaying we ought to think in our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that they are godly, is vain; for as we have no ſuch rule to go by in Gods word: ſo it is very harſh to paſſe an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical cenſure upon that ground, and the like may be ſaid of denying admiſſion thereupon: and it is alſo a very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rule for a Miniſter to go by, for ſome men judge very well of him that others judge but ſlieghtly of; and there will be a diviſion among people in their communicating together ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral judgements one of another, ſtill ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that they have fellowſhip with unbeleevers: and both Miniſters and peoples judgement very very much concerning the ſame man; according to the variety of his carriage there will ſometimes be hopes and ſometimes fears: but Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal judgement is not guided by ſuch uncertain, variable rules, neither in admiſſion nor ejection, but upon clear evidence and palpable grounds, which muſt reach all, and may be clearly known and proved.</p>
               <p>There are ſome I finde that diſtinguiſh between the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the members of the Church-Catholike viſible, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57278:141"/>
of the members of particular inſtituted Churches. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>viz.</hi> the general memberſhip, they acknowledge that theſe forenamed qualifications will be ſufficient; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will admit ſuch and their children to baptiſm, which (ſay they) is an Ordinance of the Church-Catholike viſible: and every Miniſter being a Miniſter of the Church-Catholike viſible (beſides his particular relation to his particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) may, ſay they, adminiſter baptiſm to them, though they be members of no inſtituted Churches: but to make a member of a particular inſtituted Congregation, they require evident ſigns of true grace, and a conſent and ſubmiſſion to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Diſcipline diſpenſed by the particular Officers. But this diſtinction of qualifications I finde not grounded upon the word of God, nor that any ſhould be fit to be members of the Church-Catholike viſible, and not to be members of a particular viſible Congregation. If they be brought into Chriſts ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, they are fit to have ſome of Chriſts ſhepheards to take inſpection of them: if they be admitted into Chriſts Kingdom, City, Family, they are fit to be under the regiment of ſome of his Officers. If the Ordinances of worſhip, yea, the ſeal of the Covenant be adminiſtred to them, I ſee no ground that theſe ſhould be freed from the Ordinances of Diſcipline, who in all likelihood will ſtand in moſt need thereof.</p>
               <p>The great Objection which M. <hi>Hooker</hi> urgeth againſt this aſſertion, that the particular Churches are <hi>ortae,</hi> and whereby he would prove the Church-Catholike to be <hi>Orta,</hi> is becauſe if the Church-Catholike be an integral, it is made up of the aggregation of the particulars, <hi>&amp; oritur ex illis:</hi> And every <hi>Integrum</hi> is in reſpect of the parts <hi>Symbolum effecti.</hi> And the parts muſt have a being before the whole can reſult out of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> My main intention in the Queſtion was to prove the Church-Catholike to be the prime Church in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which are enumerated in the explication of this part or the predicate of the Queſtion, to which I referre you: and that the particular Churches are ſecondary in the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes alſo.</p>
               <p>And for the particular Churches being <hi>Orta,</hi> I have already
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57278:141"/>
both in the explication of the terms of the Queſtion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. and in this ſecond part expreſſed my meaning thereof. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>My meaning is not in regard of the aggregation and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the particular Churches to make one aggregated, combined integral: for ſo indeed the Church-Catholike puts on the notion of <hi>orta.</hi> But I meant it firſt in regard the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations are made up of, and ariſe out of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church-Entitive or of viſible beleevers, which are the matter thereof. And whereas it is objected againſt this, that that Church is no political body: haply never had the ſight or knowledge one of another, never entred into agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of government one with another: and are wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, according to reaſon, and all rules of the Goſpel, of all Church-priviledges, <hi>Surv.</hi> p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>37. I anſwer, the Church indeed ſo conſidered is no actual polity, yet it is an integral, and it is viſible in regard of the perſons, covenant, laws, and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As all the ſubjects of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral in reference to the King and Laws, though they ſhould for a time want inferiour Officers. And though they be not in particular combination, and ſo are deſtitute of the particular priviledges, and have no particular Officers to diſpenſe Gods Ordinances to them conſtantly, yet have they right by reaſon and Scripture rules to all the Ordinances of God, as well as baptiſm, and they covenant to ſubmit to all Gods Ordinances, even thoſe of diſcipline: and are habitually under the habitual power of the Miniſters office, and are capable of cenſures, as hath been ſhewed before: only they want the opportunity of enjoying them conſtantly by particular Officers of their own. The right of an Engliſh man to the priviledges of the Laws, doth not ariſe by being actually under ſuch and ſuch particular Officers in a Corporation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by being members of the Kingdom. So is the right of viſible beleevers to Church-priviledges, by being Chriſts viſible ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the particular converts are brought into Chriſts Kingdom by the Church-Catholike viſible already in being: and ſpiritually conquered and ſubdued by them to Chriſt: they are the fruits and ſucceſſe of their Miniſtry, as Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57278:142"/>
Chriſts Miniſters are their ſpiritual fathers, and they are children born to the Church, and are added to the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Church doth initiate them, and miniſterially convey the priviledges to the converts, by enrowling them as free-men of the Church by baptiſm, and miniſterially ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers over them, and ſo maketh them organical alſo, and adding them into combination with themſelves: and this cannot be done as they are particular Officers, for ſo, they are not to them, Therefore as general, and it is to be accounted an act of the Church-Catholike, as hath been ſhewed before. <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>And though in a conſtant, permanent or continuous integral, whoſe particular members riſe and fall together with the whole, ſo that it cannot conſiſt but of ſo many neceſſary integral, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual parts whereof it is conſtituted. There the whole, and the parts whereof it doth conſiſt, as they ſtand in relation unto one another muſt be <hi>ſimul:</hi> yet the Church-Catholike being (as I may ſay) a kinde of <hi>diſcreet, ſucceſſive, indefinite integral,</hi> alwaies <hi>tranſient,</hi> and in <hi>flux,</hi> ſome members being alwaies in their adding, and ſome alwaies in departing, ſo that in reſpect of the particular parts it is not one hour every way the ſame it was the former, I ſay, that in reference to the members that are to be added, the whole muſt needs be accounted firſt, becauſe it is conſtituted and hath a being entitive and organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal before the addition, and the members born or converted muſt needs be firſt added to the whole, before they can bear the relation of parts unto it. And herein the Church is like unto a Corporation, whoſe firſt members whereof it was conſtituted were <hi>ſimul natura &amp; tempore</hi> with the whole, yet all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that are added ſucceſſively, finde it a Corporation before their addition: and ſo it is with the ſucceſſive members of the Church-Catholike.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> That which belongs to a ſimilar body or integral, <hi>quà tale,</hi> it doth not ariſe from the integrality, but from the nature which is common to the whole, and ſo it agreeth to it primarily, <hi>quâ tale, nun quâ totum, ſive integrum:</hi> ſo though ſuch and ſuch priviledges and Ordinances belong to the whole
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57278:142"/>
Church Catholike: yet it is not primarily, <hi>quà</hi> Catholike, or <hi>quà</hi> an Integral, but <hi>quà tale,</hi> and ſo they may belong to the parts pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, and to the whole ſecondarily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the properties of a ſimilar body do belong to it <hi>quà tale,</hi> as ſuch, yet the whole being <hi>tale</hi> they agree to the whole primarily, though they be found immediatly in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular parts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The priviledges and Ordinances of the Church do not belong to the Church primarily <hi>quâ tale,</hi> for it might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have had ſuch a nature, and yet wanted ſuch Priviledges and Ordinances: but they ariſe <hi>ex inſtitutione &amp; donatione divinâ,</hi> and from the <hi>Covenant</hi> between Chriſt and his Church, and flow from thence, and that <hi>inſtitution, donation</hi> and <hi>covenant,</hi> being firſt intended and given to the whole, the priviledges and Ordinances belong firſt to the whole, and ſecondari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the parts, though they be ſet immediatly in the parts alſo.</p>
               <p>Now then, ſeeing it is evident by the former <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> that there is a Church-Catholike viſible both <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titive</hi> and <hi>Organical:</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Names, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> of the Church, the <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God, the <hi>Offices of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Signs</hi> of the true Church, the <hi>Members</hi> of of the Church, and <hi>Ministry</hi> of the word belong firſt to the Church-Catholike viſible, and that every particular Chriſtian bears <hi>firſt and laſt relation thereunto,</hi> which relation <hi>cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off</hi> by any <hi>removal,</hi> or <hi>without ſinne,</hi> and that the <hi>particular Churches spring out of the members of the Church-Catholike,</hi> I therefore conclude, according to the light God hath given me, That the <hi>Church-Catholike viſible is Prima, in Gods intention, and by Gods institution, and by Gods donation of Ordinances and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and in dignity and authority, and in perfection, and in nature and eſſence, and in miniſterial, inſtrumental cauſality, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect cognition and noſtibility:</hi> and the particular Churches <hi>ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary or poſterior</hi> in all the forenamed reſpects: and likewiſe are <hi>Ortae</hi> in regard they are <hi>made up of the members of the Church-Entitive, and are converted instrumentally by the Church-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Organical, and initia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="1">1. That there is a Church-Catholike.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. That the Church-Catholike is viſible.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. That if the Church-Catholike be contracted into narrow limits, yet the remaining part thereof conſerves both the nature and priviledges of the Church-Catholike, and puts on the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, more properly then of a particular Church: as a City burnt down or waſted into a few ſtreets, reſerves the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Priviledges of the whole; and that which was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a part of it before, now puts on the notion of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Church-Catholike is mixt of good and bad, as well as particular Congregations are.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That the Church-Catholike may be conſidered either as Entitive or Organical.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That the Church-Catholike is one habitual, organical body, or Integral.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That the keys of Diſcipline are Catholike as well as of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That the Church-Catholike is one ſimilar body: if conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Entitive, the members are ſimilar parts of it, if as orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, the particular Churches are ſimilar parts of it.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Promiſes, Priviledges, and Ordinances of worſhip and diſcipline, belong primarily to the Church-Catholike.</p>

                  <p n="13">13. That the Priviledges and Ordinances of the Church ariſe not from the Nature of it, but from the covenant, donation, and inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="16">16. That the Church-Catholike viſible is more auguſt, and of more large authority then the particular: though the authority differs not in kinde.</p>

                  <p n="19">19. That the whole Church-Catholike is the primary and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate object <hi>(ſuo genere)</hi> of Chriſts Offices, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, but as parts thereof. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. That the Notes and Signs of the true Church belong firſt to the Church-Catholike viſible, and therefore are diſtinctive to that only.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. That the Church-Catholike viſible hath an exiſtence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and operations of its own, as it is Catholike.</p>

                  <head>Concerning particular Churches.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. That the particular Churches are made up of the members of the Church-Catholike Entitive.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the particular Churches organized, and all viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers make up the Church-Catholike Organical by aggregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the particulars are inferiour thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the particular diviſions of the Church-Catholike viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for convenient enjoyment of publike Ordinances, have the name (Church) and the Priviledges and Ordinances (as far as they are capable of them) ſecondarily in conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the particular Churches being ſimilar parts of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57278:144"/>
whole Church, having no eſſential, ſpecifical differences, are to be diſtinguiſhed by accidental differences and circumſtances, as their limits of place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they be heterogeneal to them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Many Congregations may be in the ſame community of diſcipline, and be ruled by their Elders <hi>in communi</hi> by coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo be called one Church, <hi>National, Provincial</hi> or <hi>Preſbyterial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the particular Churches claim power of diſpenſing all the Ordinances of Chriſt, by vertue of the general Charter, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and donation, they being parts of the Church, then much more may the whole Church-Catholike, for which they were primarily intended and made.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The greater the parts of the Church-Catholike be, and the more united by combitation and coordination, the ſtronger they be, and the ſmaller the diviſions be, the weaker.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The diviſion of the Church Catholike into ſmall parcels, to ſtand alone by themſelves without coordination, is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Yet neceſſity in regard of diſtance of place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may cauſe a particular Church to be Independent, and ſtand alone in regard of actual, external conſociation or combination.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The neceſſity of an explicit Covenant, as the eſſential form whereby the particular Church is conſtituted, implyeth a denial of all other Churches to be true, that are not ſo conſtituted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt want the eſſential form.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The ordinary and conſtant operations of the Officers of the Church in diſpenſation of Chriſts Ordinances are in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches primarily.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Any particular Congregation may fail, apoſtatize, or be diſſolved and ceaſe, but ſhould the Church-Catholike be reduced into ſo narrow limits, and the being thereof be reſerved therein, and it ſuſtain the notion of the Church-Catholike, God would not ſuffer it in ſuch a caſe to fail or ceaſe, for then the whole muſt ceaſe alſo.</p>

                  <head>Concerning the publike Officers of the Church.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Every Miniſter is an Officer of the Church-Catholike viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that relation is primary to him, yet the particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

he ſtands in to a particular Congregation, giveth him a more immediate eſpecial call, and charge to adminiſter the Ordinances of God conſtantly to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Any ſingle Miniſter by vertue of his office hath power mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterially to admit a member into the Church-Catholike viſible, if he be fit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although the election of a Miniſter to a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be an act of liberty in the people, yet his miſſion is from Chriſt primarily and miniſterially by the Presbytery.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He doth not adminiſter the Ordinances of God in the name of the Congregation as their ſervant, but as the ſervant of Chriſt. As a Mayor in a Corporation though choſen by the people, yet executeth his office in the Kings name.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If he adminiſtreth any Ordinances out of his own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, he doth it not as a gifted brother, but by vertue of his office, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. And the like may be ſaid of their diſpenſation of Ordinances to members of other Congregations that come to their Congregations.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Although the particular flock over which a Miniſter was ſet be diſſolved, yet he ceaſeth not to be a Miniſter, becauſe the Church to which he bare firſt relation is not diſſolved, which is the Catholike.</p>

Not endeavouring with us to reform our Churches, but to gather Churches out of our Churches, by gathering our beſt members out of our Churches, and uniting them into ſeveral bodies by a particular Covenant, though diſtant far in habitation.

                  <p>Others would wreſt the keys of the Church out of the hands of the Church-Officers, and hang them at the girdle of the civil Magiſtrate; but ſeeing God made civil and Eccleſiaſtical Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers differing in kinde, the one entruſted with a civil Magiſtracy, the other with an Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtry, as it is an uſurpation for the Church-Officers, as ſuch, to claim the power of the Magiſtrate, ſo I fear it will prove but ſacriledge for the civil Magiſtrate, as ſuch, to claim the power of the Miniſtry. If <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was ſo great a fault, I fear <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> will be as great.</p>
                  <p>Others there are who plead for liberty of judgement, conſcience and practice, that every one may hold, and hold forth what opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions he pleaſe, and be of what religion and ſect he pleaſerh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe judgement and conſcience cannot be forced, but muſt be left to God only, as they ſay: and thereby they would make <hi>England</hi> another <hi>Amsterdam</hi> of all ſects and religions: and ſome flown ſo high already as to name that City for an example and pattern of the model they would have in <hi>England:</hi> but I muſt clear our brethren in <hi>New-England</hi> from this, and commend them for baniſhing the <hi>Familists,</hi> &amp;c. from amongſt them, who would otherwiſe have utterly overthrown the peace and truth in their Churches.</p>
                  <p>Yea, generally men cover new opinions, and account it their glory to differ from others in judgement, and he is no body that hath none but old truths; and ſo men under the colour of new light and new truths, rake up a multitude of old errors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Our diviſions are in heart and affections: for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in judgement cauſeth alienation of affections, and <hi>great thoughts of heart:</hi> ſo that if there prove once a claſhing and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in opinions, though they were never ſo neer allied, or well acquainted and familiar, yet then they grow ſtrange, and fall out, and oppoſe, and cenſure each other deeply: then they are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, or Antichriſtian, or enemies to Chriſts kingly office, and hence come ſo many invectives in Pulpit and Preſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:57278:146"/>Thirdly, Our diviſions and differences are in way: for as mens judgements differ, ſo do their waies. Some are for one way of worſhip, ſome for another; ſome for one way of diſcipline, ſome another; ſome for one way of conſtituting Churches, ſome another; ſome are for gathering of new Churches out of old, and yet let the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d ones ſtand as mock-Churches, when they have gleaned all that are good out of them: they would take all the golden and ſilver veſſels, veſſels of honour, and leave none but of wood and ſtone, veſſels of diſhonour; And ſome are for ſeparation wholly, and ſo turn all the reſt over to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſt: yea, ſome ſo violent, as that they would pluck down our very meeting-houſes (tropically called Churches) which they deride by the name of <hi>Steeple-houſes.</hi> And all are in waies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſo that we are like <hi>Sampſons</hi> foxes tyed together by the tayls with firebrands between them, to burn up the ſtanding corn.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude with an earneſt deſire of, and exhortation to unity and peace. The unity of the Church ſhould be a ſtrong motive to unity in judgement, heart, and way. It is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preſſeth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace: for there is one body, and one ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. This ſpiritual unity is that which Chriſt ſo earneſtly and often prayed for in that ſhort praier, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21, 23. <hi>That they may be one as we are one, that they all may be one, that they alſo may be one in us, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> And this was <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer, <hi>Rom</hi> 15.5, 6. <hi>Now the God of patience and conſolation grant you to be like minded one towards another, according to Chriſt Jeſus, that ye may with one minde and one mouth glorifie God,</hi> &amp;c. And this was <hi>Pauls</hi> earneſt requeſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren, by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you: but that you be perfectly joyned together in the ſame minde, and the ſame judgement.</hi> And again 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. It is one of the laſt things he concludes his Epiſtle with, <hi>Finally brethren, farewel, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one minde, live in peace, and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</hi> And <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. He preſſeth it as the only thing he deſired of them, <hi>Only let your converſation be as becometh the Gospel of Chriſt, that whether I come and ſee you, or elſe be abſent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye ſtand faſt in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57278:147"/>
one spirit with one minde, ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel.</hi> Certainly unity of judgement is of more importance then we are aware of, elſe the Apoſtle would not preſſe it with ſuch ſolemn adjurations and entreaties, ſo often as he doth. Yea, when there were but two men that differed in opinion (as it is conceived) the Apoſtle thought it beſeeming Apoſtolical gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and the holy Ghoſt judged it meet for a piece of canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture to take notice of it, and compoſe it. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.2. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech Evodias, and beſeech Syntiche that they be of the ſame minde in the Lord,</hi> Though it might ſeem but womens brabbles, yet we know <hi>how great a matter a little fire kindleth,</hi> a little ſtrife and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour will <hi>encreaſe to more ungodlineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider we, that there is but one truth, and that is of God, and God is truth, and error is of the devil.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, that the underſtanding is the higheſt and foremoſt faculty of the ſoul, it is as the forehorſe in the teem, the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty; and as that is enformed, ſo the will and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and affections muſt needs work, and follow that, and if that be led into errour, it muſt neceſſarily miſleade the whole man.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, that a chief part of the image of God in man conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in knowledge, and ſo is upon the underſtanding, which by errour is defaced.</p>
                  <p>Remember, the ſolemn caveats given by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>I beſeech you, brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them. For they that are ſuch ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly, and by good words, and bleſſed or fair ſpeeches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. <hi>That we henceforth be no more children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every winde of doctrine, by the ſlieght of men, and cunning craftineſſe</hi> (or after the methods of errour) <hi>whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> Chriſt himſelf tels us, that <hi>falſe Prophets ſhall come that ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (if it were poſſible) the very elect. Behold, I have told you before,</hi> Mat. 20.30, 31. And <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Of your ſelves ſhall men ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw diſciples after them, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore watch,</hi> Act. 20.30, 31. <hi>Therefore hold faſt the form of ſound words, which thou haſt heard of me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. They
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57278:147"/>
that coin new words, and new ſtrange expreſſions to amaze the people, it is a ſign, as <hi>Calvin</hi> tels us, that they have ſome new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion upon the Anvil.</p>
                  <p>O let us labour to be of one heart, ſeeing we are all but one body, and have but one head, and one ſpirit, and becauſe we are all brethren, children of the ſame heavenly Father. This is that which God hath promiſed his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. <hi>I will give them one heart, and I will put a new ſpirit within you.</hi> And we finde Chriſt inculcating this exhortation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.34. <hi>A new Commandement I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye alſo love another. By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye love one another,</hi> Joh. 13.34, 35. Again, <hi>This is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you,</hi> Joh. 15.12. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Theſe things I command you that you love one another.</hi> And this I finde practiſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.31. <hi>And the multitude of them that beleeved were of one heart and one ſoul.</hi> And this <hi>Paul exhorteth to,</hi> Rom. 12.10. <hi>Be kindely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctioned one to another with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another.</hi> And we finde the unity both of judgement and heart exhorted unto, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Finally, be ye all of one minde, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving compaſſion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Diviſion is the devils muſick, but that which makes the devil laugh, ſhould make us cry. O what a ſolemn obſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.1, 2. <hi>If there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye may be like minded, having the ſame love, bring of one accord, of one minde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O that we might labour to be of one way alſo. This is that which God promiſed his people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.</hi> And <hi>Zep.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord with one conſent, or one ſhoulder.</hi> And this was the bleſſing that God gave <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> in his people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.12. <hi>Alſo in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to doe the commandment
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57278:148"/>
of the King, and of the Princes by the word of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly there is but one rule for doctrine, worſhip, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. And as many <hi>as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and on all the Iſrael of God,</hi> Gal. 6.16. And this is the Apoſtles exhortation, <hi>Roman.</hi> 15.6. <hi>That ye may with one minde and one mouth glorifie God,</hi> Yea, though we be not of the ſame judgement in every thing, yet as it is <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame rule, let us minde the ſame things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this unity in way is that which we have ſworn unto, and covenanted in our late <hi>National League and Covenant,</hi> in the firſt branch of it. <hi>That we ſhall endeavour to bring the Churches of God in the three Kingdomes of England, Scotland and Ireland, to the neareſt conjunction and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Religion, Confeſſion of Faith, Form of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Directory for Worſhip and Catechizing; That we and our posterity after us may as brethren live together in faith and love, and that the Lord may delight to dwell in the midſt of us,</hi> And we ſhall all be forſworn, if we endeavour it not.</p>
                  <p>All the members of the ſame body natural agree to goe the ſame way, Yea, the ſtrength, health, and beauty of the body natural, conſiſteth in the faſt knitting of all the members together to each other, and to the head, and the luxation thereof is dangerous: ſo and much more it is in a body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or Eccleſiaſtical. And though the diviſions in our civil e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate be very ſad, and might deſerve tears of bloud to bewail them, yet I look upon the diviſions in the Church as a matter of more ſad and doleful conſequence, and I fear (but wiſh I might be miſtaken) that when the breaches of the Common-wealth ſhall be cloſed, the breaches in the Church may grow wider, and the differences riſe higher: and ſuch errours are ſown among us as will not be plucked up again in our age: which having ſeized upon the underſtandings and conſciences of men, cannot be compoſed by commands, nor clubbed down by force. Only here is my comfort, that though our condition is ſuch, that we know not what to ask, yet God is wiſe, and knows what to beſtow. And this is my hope herein, that he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57278:148"/>
which found a way to reconcile God and man, when they were at enmity, can finde way to reconcile man and man, though they be at difference. <hi>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that great ſhepheard of the ſheep, through the bloud of the everlaſting Covenant, make us perfect in every good work to doe his will, working in us that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Ieſus Chriſt, to whom be glory for ever and ever.</hi> Amen. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>
